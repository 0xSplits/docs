# Splits

> Composable, open-source, audited smart contracts for managing onchain revenue. No protocol fees. Runs forever as a hyperstructure.

Splits makes it easy to split onchain payments among multiple recipients. Contracts are deployed on Ethereum, Optimism, Base, Zora, Polygon, Arbitrum, and more. All contracts use deterministic deployment (same addresses across chains).
