# Modules

Modules are smart contracts that extend the functionality of the 0xSplits
protocol. The modules included in these docs were built by the 0xSplits team and
are all available in the [app](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/new). Anyone can create
their own modules since they exist independently of the protocol.

- [Waterfall](/modules/waterfall) – set the order in which different accounts
  get paid; works well with Splits & Mutable Splits
- [Liquid Splits](/modules/liquid) – use NFTs (ERC-1155) to make ownership in a
  Split transferrable between accounts
- [Vesting](/modules/vesting) – stream multiple, isolated streams of tokens to
  an address over a set period of time; works well with Mutable Splits

You can reach out on the `dev-support` channel in
[Discord](https://chat.0xsplits.xyz/) if you have questions or want to discuss
ways to integrate. And drop us a note to share what you've built! We'd love see
how you're extending 0xSplits.
