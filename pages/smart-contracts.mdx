# Smart Contracts

The procotol consists of 3 contracts.

## `SplitMain`

- `createSplit()` - create a new `SplitProxy`
- `receiveFor(address)` - receive ETH for Split `address`. See also `receive()` under `SplitProxy`
- `receiveERC20For(address, IERC20, amount)` - receive `IERC20` for Split `address`
- `splitBalanceFor(address)` - split ETH for Split `address` which allows Owners to withdraw
- `splitERC20BalanceFor(address, IERC20)` - split `IERC20` for Split `address` which allows Owners to withdraw
- `withdrawFor(address)` - withdraw ETH for EOA/SC `address`
- `withdrawERC20For(address, IERC20)` - withdraw `IERC20` for EOA/SC `address`
- `multiSend(address[], amount[])` - one time ETH [Multisend](https://www.notion.so/Splits-Documentation-1-0-d0f572e8633f47da8ce41ab8da17ce48) inside `SplitMain` (gas-efficient if recipients are members of at least one other with ETH or are Splits themselves)
- `multiSendERC20(IERC20, address[], amount[])` - one time `IERC20` Multisend inside `SplitMain` (gas-efficient if recipients are members of at least one other Split with `IERC20` or are Splits themselves)

## `SplitWallet`

- `sendBalanceToMain` - sends the contract's balance to `SplitMain`
- `sendERC20BalanceToMain(IERC20)` - sends the contract's `IERC20` balance to `SplitMain`

## `SplitProxy`

- `receive()` - emit an event when funds are received at the proxy
- `fallback()` delegates all other calls to the implementation `SplitWallet`
