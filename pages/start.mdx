# Getting started

You can access the app by going to
[app.0xsplits.xyz](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/). Most of the app can be
experienced without connecting a wallet, but will need to connect your wallet in
order to submit transactions (i.e., create a contract, withdraw a balance, etc).

## Explore

When you first open the app, you'll be brought to the Explore page. This page
gives you an idea of the activity happening in the ecosystem and how various
projects & teams are using Splits today.

## Search

If you're looking for a specific person or contract, the easiest way to find
that is through search. Either hit `/` on your keyboard or click the search
button in the sidebar. Paste in the address or type in an ENS and hit enter.

## Connect your wallet

Connecting your wallet to the app allows you to submit transactions and see
content that's specific to your wallet â€“ things like your balances, contracts
you're earning from, and more. Click Connect Wallet in the sidebar and choose
your wallet provider.

If you're using a **Gnosis Safe**, we recommend you use the
[Gnosis 0xSplits](https://app.safe.global/share/safe-app?appUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.0xsplits.xyz&chain=eth)
app for the best experience, however you can also connect directly using
WalletConnect.
