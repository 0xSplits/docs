# Creating contracts

If you haven't already, we recommend you read the [flow of funds](/flow) page to
understand how funds move through the system and the various steps.

## Building blocks

There are two core smart contract building blocks upon which all payment flows
within 0xSplits are created: Split and Waterfall. You can stack these blocks
together in whatever order makes sense for your specific needs. These building
blocks are intentionally unopionated, however, for more opinionated payment
flows we've also created [Templates](#templates), which stack frequently used
blocks together.

### Split

Split is a smart contract that distributes funds according to pre-set
percentages. It's an **equity-like structure** that can be plugged into any
payment flow you need. To create one, just head to
[split.new](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/new/split/) and enter in two or more
recipients.

You also have the option to set an admin if you anticipate the Split needing to
change in the future. Note that the admin has complete authority to
add/remove/modify recipients and even change or remove the admin anytime. You
can make the admin any address, including a smart contract like a
[Gnosis Safe](https://safe.global/). Unless you know the Split will need to
change, we recommend not adding an admin since **a Split is only as trustworthy
as the admin**.

#### Editing

The admin may edit the Split at any time. If you are the admin, you will see a
message in the Split Recipients section notifying you of this ability. You can
either edit the Split (i.e., update the recipients and their shares), or
transfer control to a different account. Transferring control is a two-step
process, where the new admin needs to accept control after you've initiated the
transfer. The admin is also able to remove admin rights entirely, thereby
"freezing" the Split in it's current configuration forever.

### Waterfall

Waterfall allows you to define the order & amount different accounts are paid.
It is a **debt-like structure** that is useful whenever one account shoud be
paid _before_ another account. Waterfall is modular so you can pair it with
Splits, which is exactly what the [Recoup template](#recoup) does.

![Split form inputs](./img/create_waterfall_form.png)

A Waterfall has multiple levels called tranches, each with a limit and a
recipient. The limit is the maximum amount that recipient will receive, and they
receive it only when the previous tranche limit is reached. This pattern
continues until all the tranches are filled, at which point any extra funds go
to the final tranche recipient.

You can create one by heading to
[waterfall.new](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/new/waterfall) and entering in the
permitted token and add as many tranches as you'd like. The above example has
two tranches, with the first 500 DAI going to ethglobal.eth and all subsequent
DAI going to theprotocolguild.eth.

## Templates

Templates are pre-built payment flows that stack two or more building blocks
together. Since these are opinionated flows, each template has a dedicated
creation form and account detail view in the app.

### Recoup

Recoup allows you to repay one group before splitting profits with another. It
makes it easy to create a Waterfall that points to a number of Splits. Just
enter in the token and amount you wish to recoup, and then add recipients for
each tier. As long as there are two or more recipients in a tier, the Recoup
will automatically deploy the necessary Split(s) upon creation.

### Liquid Split

A Liquid Split utilizes NFTs to represent ownership in a Split, allowing
recipients to transfer their shares to others. This works by combining an
ERC-1155 NFT contract with a Split, and making the NFT contract the admin of the
Split. Whenever funds are distributed within the Split, it looks at the holders
of the NFTs and updates the recipients to match.

When you create a Liquid Split, just specify the _initial_ recipients and create
the Split as you normally would. Upon creation, each recipient will receive
their portion of the 1,000 NFTs minted. For example, if Alice is a 20%
recipient, they will receive 200 NFTs (20% of 1,000 = 200). Alice can then
transfer their shares however they want.
