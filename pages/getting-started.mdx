# Getting Started

## Using the App

Navigate to the [New Split](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/split/) page and add each [Owner](/core-concepts#owner)'s address (using ENS or hex) and the portion of the Split's income they'll receive.
Since Owners are just other accounts, they can be any EOA or SC, including other Splits!

**Confirm the transaction and you're done!** Once your Split has been created, any ETH or ERC20s sent to its address
will be split among the Owners, forever, without you having to do anything.

There are two optional parameters:

1. You can change the [Splitter Fee](/core-concepts#splitter-fee).
   The Splitter Fee incentivizes third parties to split the [balance](/core-concepts#balance) on behalf of the Owners.
   A higher fee leads to more frequent distributions, but is a tax on the Owners.

2. You can make this a [Mutable Split](/core-concepts#mutable-split).
   To do this, just toggle the Mutable switch and specify which account can modify it.
   This account defaults to your own address, and can be any EOA or SC.

## Calling the Contracts

You can call the contracts directly if you want to integrate Splits into your own app.
All you have to do is call [`createSplit`](/smart-contracts#createsplit) on [`Split-Main`](/smart-contracts#splitmain) and pass through the hash of Owners, ownership percentages, the splitter fee, and if the Split is mutable, a controlling address.
You can read more in the [Smart Contracts](/smart-contracts) section.
