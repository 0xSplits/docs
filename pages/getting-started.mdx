# Getting Started

## Using the App

Once you've connected to the app, navigate to the [New Split](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/split/) page and add each [Owner](/core-concepts#owner)'s address (using ENS or hex) and the portion of the Split's income they'll receive.
Owners can be any externally owned account (EOA) or smart contract (SC), including other Splits.

If you want, you can change the [Splitter Fee](/core-concepts#splitter-fee) from the default 0.5%.
You can also make your Split [mutable](/core-concepts#mutable-split).
To do this, just toggle the Mutable swtich and specify the account that can modify it.
This account defaults to your own address, but can be any EOA or SC.

That's it!
Once your Split has been created, any ETH or ERC20s sent to its address will be split among the Owners, forever, without you having to do anything.

## Calling the Contracts

You can call the contracts directly if you want to integrate Splits into your own app.
All you have to do is call `createSplit` on `SplitMain` and pass through the hash of an array of Owners & ownership percentages, the splitter fee, and a controlling address if the Split is mutable.
You can read more in the [Smart Contracts](/smart-contracts) section.
