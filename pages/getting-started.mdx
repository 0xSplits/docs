# Getting Started

## Using the App

Creating a Split only takes a few seconds. Just navigate to the
[New Split](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/split/) page, and add each
[Owner](/core-concepts#owner)'s address (using ENS or hex) and the portion of
the income they'll receive. Because each Owner is just an address, Splits can
send funds to any EOA or other SC, including other Splits. Make sure ownership
adds to 100%, confirm the transaction, and you're done! ðŸŽ‰

Once your Split has been created, any ETH or ERC20s sent to its address will be
split among the Owners, forever, without you having to do anything. There are
two optional parameters:

1. You can change the [Splitter Fee](/core-concepts#splitter-fee). The Splitter
   Fee incentivizes third parties to split the [balance](/core-concepts#balance)
   on behalf of the Owners. The fee can be 0-10%. A higher fee leads to more
   frequent distributions, but it reduces the amount each Owner receives since
   it's deducted from the balance.

2. You can make this a [Mutable Split](/core-concepts#mutable-split). To do
   this, just toggle the Mutable switch and specify the address that can control
   the Split. This address defaults to your own address, and can be any EOA or
   SC.

## Calling the Contracts

You can call the contracts directly if you want to integrate Splits into your
own app. All you have to do is call
[`createSplit`](/smart-contracts#createsplit) on
[`Split-Main`](/smart-contracts#splitmain) and pass through the hash of Owners,
ownership percentages, the splitter fee, and if the Split is mutable, a
controlling address. You can read more in the
[Smart Contracts](/smart-contracts) section.
