# Get Started

## Use the App

Once you've connected to the app, you can easily create a Split by just adding each owner's address (ENS or hex) and assigning ownership percentages.

<Callout>
  Owners can be any EOA or smart contract, including other Splits.
</Callout>

Specify the Splitter Fee and whether the Split should be mutable.

<Callout>
  Mutable Splits are more flexible, but require more trust. It's encouraged to
  make the controlling address a [multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/).
</Callout>

_TODO: insert image_

Create your Split and you are good to go! Any ETH or ERC20s sent to your Split's address will always be distributed among the owners.

## Call the Contracts

If you want to integrate Splits into your own app you can call the contracts directly. All you have to do is call `createSplit` on `SplitMain` and pass through an array of Owners and ownership percentages.
