- Audited, open source, and verified contracts
- Fine-tuned and very gas efficient (see
  [Gas Estimates](/appendices/gas-estimates))
- Works with ETH & ERC20 tokens
- Live on multiple chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum)
- Operates entirely onchain – no third-party dependencies
- Non-upgradable contracts – guaranteed no breaking changes or rug pulls
- Maximally composable – even able to receive from `call` with capped gas
- Batched withdrawals – withdraw across all Splits in a _single_ transaction
  (not a multicall)
- Withdraw on behalf of any other account (e.g., other Recipients, smart
  contracts)
- Automated – bots & third-parties can be incentivized to distribute balances so
  Recipients don't have to
- Stackable – Splits can fund other Splits and [modules](/modules/overview)
- Mutable – Splits can be configured to be modified by a designated account (EOA
  or SC)
