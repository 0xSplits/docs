  contracts
- Fine-tuned and [gas efficient](/appendices/gas-estimates)
- Compatible with ETH & ERC-20 tokens
- Live on most EVM chains: Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis, and
  others
- Non-upgradable contracts – guaranteed no breaking changes or rug pulls
- Operates entirely onchain – no third-party dependencies
- Maximally composable – even able to receive from `call` with capped gas
- Batched withdrawals – withdraw across all Splits in a _single_ transaction
  (not a multicall)
- Withdraw on behalf of any other account (e.g., other Recipients, smart
  contracts)
- Automated – bots & third-parties can be incentivized to distribute balances so
  Recipients don't have to
- Stackable – Splits can fund other Splits and [modules](/modules/overview)
- Mutable – Splits can be configured to be modified by a designated account
  (EOA, Gnosis Safe, custom smart contract, etc)
