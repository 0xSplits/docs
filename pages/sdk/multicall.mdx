# Multicall

Batch transactions together into a single multicall transaction. This multicall function can be accessed 
through any of the sdk clients (Splits, Waterfall, Liquid Splits, Vesting).

### multicall

Any write function from the SDK has a corresponding call data version that generates call data instead
of submitting a transaction. That call data can be passed into a multicall transaction. Here is an 
example where a liquid split is a recipient of a split. First we distribute a token on the split, then 
we withdraw that token for the liquid split from SplitMain, then we distribute the liquid split.

```
const splitDistributionArgs = {
  splitAddress: "0xd9137B84f56D61Bb961082DD9Eb21bE3D7B14cB9",
  token: "0x64d91f12ece7362f91a6f8e7940cd55f05060b92",
  distributorAddress: "0x2fa128274cfcf47afd4dc03cd3f2a59af09b6a72",
}
const splitDistributionCallData = await splitsClient.callData.distributeToken(splitDistributionArgs)

const withdrawArgs = {
  address: "0xb5Ce41320F3d486671918733BB3226E3981Db62b",
  tokens: ["0x64d91f12ece7362f91a6f8e7940cd55f05060b92"],
}
const withdrawCallData = await splitsClient.callData.withdrawFunds(withdrawArgs)

const liquidSplitDistributionArgs = {
  liquidSplitAddress: "0xb5Ce41320F3d486671918733BB3226E3981Db62b",
  token: "0x64d91f12ece7362f91a6f8e7940cd55f05060b92",
  distributorAddress: "0x2fa128274cfcf47afd4dc03cd3f2a59af09b6a72",
}
const liquidSplitDistributionCallData = await splitsClient.liquidSplits.callData.distributeToken(liquidSplitDistributionArgs)

const response = await splitsClient.multicall({
  calls: [splitDistributionCallData, withdrawCallData, liquidSplitDistributionCallData],
})
```

Arguments
```graphql
{
  calls: CallData[] # call data objects can be generated by calling splitsClient.callData.functionName
}
```

Response
```graphql
{
  events: Log[]
}
```
