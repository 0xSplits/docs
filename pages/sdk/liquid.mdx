# Liquid Splits

Begin by importing `LiquidSplitClient` into your app. If you are using the
`SplitsClient`, you can access the liquid split client as well.

```js
import { LiquidSplitClient } from '@0xsplits/splits-sdk'

const liquidSplitClient = new LiquidSplitClient({
  chainId,
  publicClient, // viem public client (optional, required if using any of the contract functions)
  walletClient, // viem wallet client (optional, required if using any contract write functions. must have an account already attached)
  includeEnsNames, // boolean, defaults to false. If true, will return ens names for any liquid split holder (only for mainnet)
  // If you want to return ens names on chains other than mainnet, you can pass in a mainnet public client
  // here. Be aware though that the ens name may not necessarily resolve to the proper address on the
  // other chain for non EOAs (e.g. Gnosis Safe's)
  ensPublicClient, // viem public client (optional)
})
```

OR

```js
import { SplitsClient } from '@0xsplits/splits-sdk'

const splitsClient = new SplitsClient({
  chainId,
  publicClient,
  walletClient,
  includeEnsNames,
  ensPublicClient,
})

const liquidSplitClient = splitsClient.liquidSplits
```

Now you're ready to use any of the functions. All Arguments and Responses for
these functions are `objects`. This will make it easier for us to release
updates to the SDK without breaking existing implementations.

The SDK comprises 3 different types of functions: Subgraph Reads, Liquid Split
Writes, and Liquid Split Reads.

## Subgraph Reads

These functions make it easier to query the [subgraph](/subgraph).

### getLiquidSplitMetadata

Returns all metadata for a given `liquidSplitAddress`.

Usage

```js
const args = {
  liquidSplitAddress: '0xb5Ce41320F3d486671918733BB3226E3981Db62b',
}

const response = await liquidSplitClient.getLiquidSplitMetadata(args)
```

Arguments

```graphql
{
  liquidSplitAddress: string
}
```

Response

```graphql
{
  type: 'LiquidSplit'
  address: string
  distributorFeePercent: number
  payoutSplitAddress: string
  isFactoryGenerated: boolean
  holders: {
    percentAllocation: number
    recipient: {
      address: string
      ensName?: string
    }
  }[]
}
```

## Liquid Split Writes

These functions make it easier to call
[Liquid Split functions](/templates/liquid).

### createLiquidSplit

Creates a new Liquid Split contract.

Usage

```js
const args = {
  holders: [
    {
      address: "0x442C01498ED8205bFD9aaB6B8cc5C810Ed070C8f",
      percentAllocation: 50.0
    },
    {
      address: "0xc3313847E2c4A506893999f9d53d07cDa961a675",
      percentAllocation: 50.0
    }
  ],
  distributorFeePercent: 1.0000,
  owner: "0x442C01498ED8205bFD9aaB6B8cc5C810Ed070C8f",
}

const response = await liquidSplitClient.createLiquidSplit(args)
```

Arguments

```graphql
{
  holders: {
    address: string
    percentAllocation: number # >0 and <100 and up to 1 decimal
  }[]
  distributorFeePercent: number # <10 and up to 4 decimals
  owner?: string # defaults to signer
}
```

Response

```graphql
{
  liquidSplitAddress: string
  event: Log # CreateLS1155Clone emitted on LiquidSplitFactory
}
```

### distributeToken

Distributes the current token balance for the given liquid split to the current
NFT holders

Usage

```js
const args = {
  liquidSplitAddress: "0xb5Ce41320F3d486671918733BB3226E3981Db62b",
  token: "0x64d91f12ece7362f91a6f8e7940cd55f05060b92",
  distributorAddress: "0x2fa128274cfcf47afd4dc03cd3f2a59af09b6a72"
}

const response = await liquidSplitClient.distributeToken(args)
```

Arguments

```graphql
{
  liquidSplitAddress: string
  token: string
  distributorAddress?: string # defaults to signer
}
```

Response

```graphql
{
  event: Log # DistributeETH or DistributeERC20 emitted on the Liquid Split contract
}
```

### transferOwnership

Transfer ownership of the given liquid split to the `newOwner`. Only callable by
the owner of the liquid split contract.

Usage

```js
const args = {
  liquidSplitAddress: "0xb5Ce41320F3d486671918733BB3226E3981Db62b",
  newOwner: "0x2fa128274cfcf47afd4dc03cd3f2a59af09b6a72"
}

const response = await liquidSplitClient.transferOwnership(args)
```

Arguments

```graphql
{
  liquidSplitAddress: string
  newOwner: string
}
```

Response

```graphql
{
  event: Log # OwnershipTransferred emitted on the Liquid Split contract
}
```

## Gas Estimation

The client has a gas estimation feature that can be used with any of the above
write functions. Just call the function off of the `estimateGas` property.
Estimating the gas for the create liquid split function would look like:

```js
const args = {
  holders: [
    {
      address: "0x442C01498ED8205bFD9aaB6B8cc5C810Ed070C8f",
      percentAllocation: 50.0
    },
    {
      address: "0xc3313847E2c4A506893999f9d53d07cDa961a675",
      percentAllocation: 50.0
    }
  ],
  distributorFeePercent: 1.0000,
  owner: "0x442C01498ED8205bFD9aaB6B8cc5C810Ed070C8f"
}

const gasEstimate = await liquidSplitClient.estimateGas.createLiquidSplit(args)
```

## CallData

The client has a call data feature that can be used with any of the above
write functions. Just call the function off of the `callData` property.
Generating call data for the create liquid split function would look like:

```js
const args = {
  holders: [
    {
      address: "0x442C01498ED8205bFD9aaB6B8cc5C810Ed070C8f",
      percentAllocation: 50.0
    },
    {
      address: "0xc3313847E2c4A506893999f9d53d07cDa961a675",
      percentAllocation: 50.0
    }
  ],
  distributorFeePercent: 1.0000,
  owner: "0x442C01498ED8205bFD9aaB6B8cc5C810Ed070C8f"
}

const callData = await liquidSplitClient.callData.createLiquidSplit(args)
