# Templates

Begin by importing `TemplatesClient` into your app. If you are using the
`SplitsClient`, you can access the templates client as well.

```js
import { TemplatesClient } from '@0xsplits/splits-sdk'

const templatesClient = new TemplatesClient({
  chainId,
  provider, // ethers provider
  signer, // ethers signer
})
```

OR

```js
import { SplitsClient } from '@0xsplits/splits-sdk'

const splitsClient = new SplitsClient({
  chainId,
  provider,
  signer,
  includeEnsNames,
  ensProvider,
})

const templatesClient = splitsClient.templates
```

Now you're ready to use any of the functions. All Arguments and Responses for
these functions are `objects`. This will make it easier for us to release
updates to the SDK without breaking existing implementations.

## Template Writes

These functions make it easier to call various template contracts that combine Split
core contracts together.

### createRecoup

Calls a helper contract that creates a new Waterfall and potentially multiple
Splits (a Waterfall tranche with multiple recipients will be a Split). A CreateRecoup
event with the waterfall contract address is emitted by the helper contract and the
Splits Subgraph will pick this up so that these Recoup Waterfalls can be displayed
differently.

Usage

```js
const args = {
  token: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  tranches: [
    {
      recipient: "0x442C01498ED8205bFD9aaB6B8cc5C810Ed070C8f",
      size: 5.2 # Receives the first 5.2 eth
    },
    {
      recipient: "0xc3313847E2c4A506893999f9d53d07cDa961a675",
      size: 3 # Receives the next 3 eth
    },
    {
      recipient: {
        recipients: [
            {
                address: "0x442C01498ED8205bFD9aaB6B8cc5C810Ed070C8f",
                percentAllocation: 50
            },
            {
                address: "0xc3313847E2c4A506893999f9d53d07cDa961a675",
                percentAllocation: 30
            },
            {
                address: "0xEc8Bfc8637247cEe680444BA1E25fA5e151Ba342",
                percentAllocation: 20
            }
        ],
        distributorFeePercent: 1
      }
    }
  ]
}

const response = await templatesClient.createRecoup(args)
```

Arguments

```graphql
{
  token: string
  tranches: {
    recipient: string | {
        recipients: {
            address: string
            percentAllocation: number # >0 and <100 and up to 4 decimals
        }[]
        distributorFeePercent: number # <10 and up to 4 decimals
        controller?: string # defaults to AddressZero for an immutable split
    }
    size?: number # the last tranche should have no size set, as it will receive all residual funds
  }[]
  nonWaterfallRecipientAddress?: string # defaults to AddressZero
  nonWaterfallRecipientTrancheIndex?: number # defaults to undefined
}
```

Response

```graphql
{
  waterfallModuleId: string
  event: Event # CreateRecoup emitted on Recoup
}
```

#### Note on non-waterfall recipient
If you want to set the non-waterfall recipient (i.e. the address that can receive any
token that is not the waterfall token), you can use either nonWaterfallRecipientAddress
or nonWaterfallRecipientTrancheIndex. If you have an address, set that. If you want to
make a specific tranche the non-waterfall recipient, set the tranche index
(remember that the first tranche is index 0). If you do not set either of them, the 
non-waterfall recipient will get set to the zero address, which means non-waterfall 
tokens can be recovered to any tranche recipient.

#### Note on existing immutable splits
If you are including an existing immutable split in the create recoup input, you must
use just the Split's address and not the recipients/percent allocations for it. If you 
pass in the recipients the transaction will fail when it goes to create that immutable
split since it already exists.

### createDiversifier

Calls a helper contract that creates a new PassThroughWallet, a new Split, and potentially multiple
Swappers. A CreateDiversifier event with the pass through wallet contract address is emitted by the
helper contract and the Splits Subgraph will pick this up so that these Diversifiers can be displayed
properly.

Usage

```js
const args = {
  owner: "0x442C01498ED8205bFD9aaB6B8cc5C810Ed070C8f"
  oracleParams: {
    address: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  },
  recipients: [
    {
      address: "0x442C01498ED8205bFD9aaB6B8cc5C810Ed070C8f",
      percentAllocation: 60
    }
    {
      swapperParams: {
        beneficiary: "0x442C01498ED8205bFD9aaB6B8cc5C810Ed070C8f",
        tokenToBeneficiary: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        defaultScaledOfferFactorPercent: 1,
        scaledOfferFactorOverrides: [
          {
            baseToken: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
            quoteToken: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
            scaledOfferFactorPercent: 0.1,
          }
        ],
      },
      percentAllocation: 40
    }
  ]
}

const response = await templatesClient.createRecoup(args)
```

  owner: string
  paused?: boolean # defaults to false

    address?: string
    createOracleParams?: {
