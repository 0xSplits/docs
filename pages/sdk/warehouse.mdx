# Warehouse

Begin by importing `WarehouseClient` into your app.

```js
import { WarehouseClient } from '@0xsplits/splits-sdk'

const warehouseClient = new WarehouseClient({
  chainId,
  publicClient, // viem public client (optional, required if using any of the contract functions)
  walletClient, // viem wallet client (optional, required if using any contract write functions. must have an account already attached)
  includeEnsNames, // boolean, defaults to false. If true, will return ens names for any split recipient or controller (only for mainnet)
  // If you want to return ens names on chains other than mainnet, you can pass in a mainnet public client
  // here. Be aware though that the ens name may not necessarily resolve to the proper address on the
  // other chain for non EOAs (e.g. Gnosis Safe's)
  ensPublicClient, // viem public client (optional)
  apiConfig, // Splits GraphQL API key config, this is required for the data client to access the splits graphQL API
})
```
