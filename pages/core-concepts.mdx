# Core Concepts

### Split

A Split is a smart contract that receives and splits incoming funds. Each Split
has an address, a set of Owners, a balance, and a splitter fee. Just like any
other payable smart contract, funds can be sent to the Split's address from any
other EOA or smart contract. Optionally, a Split can be
[mutable](/core-concepts#mutable-split), allowing it to be modified after
creation.

### Owner

An Owner is an externally owned account (EOA) or smart contract (SC) that earns
a portion of the Split's income. Owners can be other Splits. Owners do not need
direct control of the account, since funds can be withdrawn for the Owner wallet
by a third party.

### Balance

Each Split has a balance that increases whenever income is received. This
balance must be distributed to the Owners before it can be withdrawn by the
Owners.

### Splitter Fee

This is the portion of a Split's balance that's earned in exchange for
distributing the balance. This fee incentivizes third parties to pay the gas
needed to distribute a Split's balance on behalf of the Owners, while making the
distribution cost borne by owners. This fee may be set to 0 for manual or
progressive distributions.

### Splitter

The Splitter is any account (EOA or SC) that distributes a Split's balance
amongst Owners, and earns a Splitter Fee. This architecture allows the gas
needed to distribute funds to be borne in a flat or progressive manner, making
it in aggregate more gas efficient for the Owners.

### Withdraw

Accounts with a positive balance can withdraw their funds across all of the
Splits they receive from in a single transaction. A third party can withdraw for
any account, enabling smart contracts who have no user-controlled private keys
to still receive their funds.

### Mutable Split

  Mutability increases flexibility but requires more trust.
</Callout>

A Mutable Split operates just like a normal Split, with the only difference
being that it can be modified in the future. Only one account, which is set
during Split creation, can modify the Split. This account can be any valid
address (EOA, multisig, SC with custom logic, etc). This account has the ability
to modify the owners & splitter fee, transfer control of the Split to a
different account, or make the Split immutable. A Mutable Split can be made
immutable, but immutable Splits can never become mutable.
