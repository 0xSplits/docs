# Distributing Balances

All ETH and ERC-20 tokens sent to a Split are stored in the contract until a
distribution occurs. You can see all the token balances in the Earnings section
on the right side of a Split's account page. Anyone may initiaite a distribution
simply by selecting the balances and hitting the "Distribute" button.

If the Split creator set a distribution incentive, it will be displayed above
the list of balances. Whoever performs the distribution will receive that
portion of the balance distributed. The above Split has a 1% distribution
incentive.

### Distributing and withdrawing

There are scenarios in which one may want to distribute a balance _and_ withdraw
for all Recipients in the Split. This saves each Recipient from having to
withdraw individually, and can be particularly useful if some of the Recipients
are unable to withdraw for themselves (e.g., smart contracts unable to execute
arbitrary transactions). You can do this by selecting the relevant balances,
hitting the dropdown button to the right of "Distribute", and selecting
"Distribute & withdraw for all".
