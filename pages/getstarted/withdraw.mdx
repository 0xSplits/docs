# Withdrawing Funds

One of the major advantages of using 0xSplits is that regardless of how many
Splits youâ€™re receiving from or how frequently those Splits earn income, it only
takes a single transaction to transfer all of your balances to your wallet. You
can do this at your leisure, whenever gas prices are low or you just want to
cash out.

Once you've connected your wallet, just navigate to your Overview page, select
the balances you wish to withdraw, and smash the "Withdraw" button. Once the
transaction has been confirmed, you'll see that those funds have been
transferred to your wallet and your balance within Splits has been reset.

### Withdrawing For Another Account

Since Recipients in a Split can be any Ethereum address, including smart
contracts to which nobody holds the private keys, you're able to withdraw
balances on behalf of other Recipients. When you do this, you're effectively
paying the gas needed to push the Recipient's funds to their wallet.

We're building a UI to handle this, but in the meantime you can do this via the
contracts directly by calling [`withdraw`](/natspec/SplitMain#withdraw) on
[`SplitMain`](/smart-contracts#splitmain).

### Why Must You Withdraw?

In other words, once the balance of a Split has been distributed, why aren't
they automatically showing up in your account? The withdraw flow follows a
[pull model](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/pull_over_push.html)
(i.e., you need to _pull_ your funds from 0xSplits into your account) for two
primary reasons.

First, the pull model is more reliable and secure, and is therefore the
[recommended approach](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/general/external-calls/#favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls)
in Solidity. Pushing funds is not recommended because it's more likely to fail
and it increases the chance of hitting problems with the gas limit.

Second, the pull model increases gas-efficiency for the recipients. Since all
your Splits deposit into the same place, you can collect all your distributed
balances in a single transaction. The longer you wait to withdraw your funds,
the more money piles up, and the more gas you save.
