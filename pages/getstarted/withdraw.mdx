# Withdrawing Funds

One of the major advantages of using 0xSplits is that regardless of how many
Splits youâ€™re receiving from or how frequently those Splits earn income, it only
takes a single transaction to transfer all of your balances to your wallet. You
can do this at your leisure, whenever gas prices are low or you just want to
cash out.

If you have balances available to withdraw, you can see this within the Overview
menu item or on the Overview page.

To withdraw your balances, just navigate to your Overview page, select the
balances you wish to withdraw, and hit the "Withdraw" button. Once the
transaction has been confirmed, you'll see that those funds have been
transferred to your wallet and your balance within Splits has been reset.

### Why Must You Withdraw?

In other words, once the balance of a Split has been distributed, why aren't the
funds automatically showing up in your account? This is because the withdraw
flow follows a
[pull model](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/pull_over_push.html)
(i.e., you need to _pull_ your funds from 0xSplits into your account). It's
designed this way for two primary reasons.

First, the pull model is more reliable and secure, and is therefore the
[recommended approach](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/general/external-calls/#favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls)
in Solidity. Pushing funds is not recommended because it's more likely to fail
and it increases the chance of hitting problems with the gas limit.

Second, the pull model increases gas-efficiency for the recipients. Since all
your Splits deposit into the same place, you can collect all your distributed
balances in a single transaction. The longer you wait to withdraw your funds,
the more money piles up, and the more gas you save.

### Withdrawing For Another Account

Since Recipients in a Split can be any Ethereum address, including smart
contracts unable to withdraw funds themselves, anyone can withdraw balances on
behalf of other Recipients. When you do this, you're effectively paying the gas
needed to push the Recipient's funds to their wallet. We're adding this
functionality to the app, but you can do this manually via Etherscan today.

Before withdrawing, you should check that the account in question has a balance.
You can read the balance by calling the `getETHBalance` and `getERC20Balance`
functions on
[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2ed6c4B5dA6378c7897AC67Ba9e43102Feb694EE#readContract).

To manually withdraw ETH for a Receipient using Etherscan, follow these steps:

1. Go to the
   [SplitMain contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2ed6c4B5dA6378c7897AC67Ba9e43102Feb694EE#writeContract)
   on Etherscan.
2. Make sure you're on the Contract tab, have selected "Write Contract", and
   have connected to Web3.

3. Scroll down to the `withdraw` function and paste in the recipient's address,
   make the `withdrawETH` field equal to `1`, leave the `tokens` field empty,
   and hit the "Write" button.

If you wish to withdraw the balance for an ERC20 token, follow the same steps
but make the `withdrawETH` field equal to `0` and paste the ERC20 token
addresses you wish to withdraw in the `tokens` field. Make sure to enclose the
ERC20 token address(es) in brackets, and separate with a comma if you're
withdrawing multiple at once.
