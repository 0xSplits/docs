# Withdrawing Funds

One of the major advantages of using 0xSplits is that regardless of how many
Splits you’re receiving from—or how frequently those Splits earn income—it only
takes a single, simple transaction to transfer all of your balances to your
wallet.

Once you've connected your wallet, navigate to your Overview page and select the
balances you wish to withdraw. Once the transaction has been confirmed, you'll
see that those funds have been transferred to your wallet.

### Withdrawing For Another Account

Since Owners in a Split can be any Ethereum address, including smart contracts
to which nobody holds the private keys, you're able to withdraw balances on
behalf of other Owners. When you do this, you're effectively paying the gas
needed to push the Owner's funds to their wallet.

We're building a UI to handle this, but in the meantime you can do this via the
contracts directly by calling [`withdrawFor`](/natspec/SplitMain#withdrawfor) on
[`SplitMain`](/smart-contracts#splitmain).
