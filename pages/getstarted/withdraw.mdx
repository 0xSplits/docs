# Withdrawing Funds

One of the major advantages of using 0xSplits is that regardless of how many
Splits youâ€™re receiving from or how frequently those Splits earn income, it only
takes a single transaction to transfer all of your balances to your wallet. You
can do this at your leisure, whenever gas prices are low or you just want to
cash out.

Below interactive demo to see how withdrawing funds works. More detailed
instructions follow.

If you have balances available to withdraw, you can see this within the
navigation menu at the top of the screen. Note that you may see "$0.00" if you
have ERC20 balances where the price of the token is unknown.

When you click on the withdraw dropdown, you'll see all your current balances.
Select the balances you wish to withdraw and hit the "withdraw" button. Once the
transaction has been confirmed, you'll see that those funds have been
transferred to your wallet and your balance within Splits has been reset.

### Why Must You Withdraw?

In other words, once the balance of a Split has been distributed, why aren't the
funds automatically showing up in your account? This is because the withdraw
flow follows a
[pull model](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/pull_over_push.html)
(i.e., you need to _pull_ your funds from 0xSplits into your account). It's
designed this way for two primary reasons.

First, the pull model is more reliable and secure, and is therefore the
[recommended approach](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/general/external-calls/#favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls)
in Solidity. Pushing funds is not recommended because it's more likely to fail
and it increases the chance of hitting problems with the gas limit.

Second, the pull model increases gas-efficiency for the recipients. Since all
your Splits deposit into the same place, you can collect all your distributed
balances in a single transaction. The longer you wait to withdraw your funds,
the more money piles up, and the more gas you save.

### Withdrawing For Another Account

Since Recipients in a Split can be any Ethereum address, including smart
contracts unable to withdraw funds themselves, anyone can withdraw balances on
behalf of other Recipients. When you do this, you're effectively paying the gas
needed to push the Recipient's funds to their wallet.

Just navigate to the account's detail page (either by clicking on it from the
list of recipients, or by entering it into the URL
`app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/address_goes_here`), select the balances you wish to
withdraw, and hit "withdraw".

Note that these balances will be transferred to the account's address, not your
own. By withdrawing the balances _for_ another account, you are just paying the
gas needed to send them their funds.

If you're a developer looking to incorporate withdrawals from 0xSplits into into
your own app, doing so is easy. Just call the
[`withdraw`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain#withdraw) function on `SplitMain`. You
can see if the account in question has a balance by calling the `getETHBalance`
and `getERC20Balance` functions on `SplitMain` as well.
