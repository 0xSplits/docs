# Withdrawing Funds

One of the major advantages of using 0xSplits is that regardless of how many
Splits you’re receiving from—or how frequently those Splits earn income—it only
takes a single, simple transaction to transfer all of your balances to your
wallet. You can do this at your leisure, whenever gas prices are low or you just
want to cash out.

Once you've connected your wallet, just navigate to your Overview page, select
the balances you wish to withdraw, and hit "Withdraw". Once the transaction has
been confirmed, you'll see that those funds have been transferred to your wallet
and your balance within Splits has been reset.

### Withdrawing For Another Account

Since Recipients in a Split can be any Ethereum address, including smart
contracts to which nobody holds the private keys, you're able to withdraw
balances on behalf of other Recipients. When you do this, you're effectively
paying the gas needed to push the Recipient's funds to their wallet.

We're building a UI to handle this, but in the meantime you can do this via the
contracts directly by calling [`withdraw`](/natspec/SplitMain#withdraw) on
[`SplitMain`](/smart-contracts#splitmain).
