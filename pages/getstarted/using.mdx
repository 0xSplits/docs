# Using A Split

Just like any other payable smart contract, each Split has a unique address to
which funds can be sent. Navigate to the Split's detail page, copy the Split’s
address, and paste it wherever you want. You can send funds from any exchange
(Coinbase, Gemini, etc), marketplace (OpenSea, Foundation, etc), user owned
account/wallet (MetaMask, Rainbow, etc), or smart contract (Mirror, Zora, etc).

Here's how you can integrate Splits into a few common platforms:

## OpenSea

When creating a collection on OpenSea, you can add a creator fee and specify the
address to which the creator fee will be sent. OpenSea’s instructions are
[here](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500009575482-How-do-creator-fees-work-on-OpenSea).
In the final step, just paste your Split’s address into the “payout address”
field. All future creator fees will automatically be sent to the Split, and then
distributed among the Owners.

At this time, OpenSea does not allow for a user to set a payout address on an
individual item. Creator fees, and the associated payout address (ie a Split),
can
[only be added](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500011590241-What-are-OpenSea-s-fees-#:~:text=%C2%A0-,Splitting%20Revenue,-If%20you%20are)
at the Collection level. In the future, we hope to see more platforms follow
[Zora’s approach](https://zine.zora.co/zora-v3) in letting creators specify a
“funds recipient” field on a per-item basis.

## Foundation

While creating a NFT on Foundation, creators can optionally split earnings for
that NFT with up to 3 other recipients. Foundation’s native splits feature can
be a bit limiting, but extending it using 0xSplits is very easy. All you have to
do is paste your Split’s address into the recipient field while
[creating a split](https://help.foundation.app/en/articles/5305276-how-can-i-create-a-split-on-foundation)
in Foundation.

Whenever a work is sold on Foundation, your Split owners will receive their
share. There are a number of benefits to using 0xSplits within Foundation
instead of the native split feature.

- The Splits created on 0xSplits are interoperable and can be used on any
  marketplace or platform. The exact same Split can be used on Foundation,
  OpenSea, Zora, and anywhere else, simultaneously. Decoupling the Split from
  the NFT allows for a higher level of interopability and massive gas-savings.
- You can include far more recipients using 0xSplits. Foundation limits you to 4
  total recipients, including yourself. On 0xSplits, the upper limit is ~500
  recipients.
- 0xSplits gives you the option of making your Splits mutable. This means that
  you can change the recipients & percentages without needing to burn your NFT
  and mint the piece again.
- 0xSplits exist entirely onchain, meaning they’re permissionless and censorship
  resistant. The only way your Split will stop running is if Ethereum stops
  operating. There are no third parties to rely on when using 0xSplits.
- Finally, Foundation splits are coupled with the NFT minting process, meaning
  each additional recipient increases gas costs for both minting and claiming an
  NFT. This is why Foundation has limited their splits to including only 4
  recipients.

## Zora

Zora’s [V3 contracts](https://zine.zora.co/zora-v3) allow for developers to
specify a “seller funds recipient”. This is the address that funds are sent to
once the NFT is sold. As of now, Zora
[does not allow](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/5577498-revenue-splits) a
user to specify this address through their app/interface directly, but hopefully
this is coming soon.

That said, it's very easy to integrate 0xSplits if you're a developer using
Zora's contracts. All you have to do is set the
[`sellerFundsRecipient`](https://docs.zora.co/docs/smart-contracts/modules/Asks/zora-v3-asks-v1.1#ask-structure)
to the Split's address.
