# Using Splits

Just like any other payable smart contract, each Split has a unique address at
which it can receive funds. Funds can be sent from any exchange, marketplace,
wallet, or smart contract, including those with hard gas limits. Splits can only
distribute ETH and ERC20 tokens. **NFTs sent to a Split will be permanently
lost.**

You can locate a Split's address by viewing its detail page within the app
(example
[here](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF8843981e7846945960f53243cA2Fd42a579f719/)).
The Split's address is displayed in 2 places: the URL of the page itself, and
the "Address" section in the upper right of the page. Any ETH & ERC20s sent to
this address will be split among the recipients.

To find a specific Split, you can search by pressing `/` anywhere within the app
(or by hitting üîç in the nav). If you're unable to locate a Split but know one
of the recipients, just search for their ENS/address and then look for the Split
in the "Receiving" tab.

To find all the Splits you receive from, either connect your wallet (double
check your connected network) and look under the "Receiving" tab on your home
page, or paste in your address or ENS into the search input to navgiate to your
account view (the Splits you receive from will be under the "Receiving" tab). If
you've tried both of these and still can't find your Splits, reach out to us in
the `user-support` channel in [Discord](https://chat.0xsplits.xyz/).

## Third Party Platforms

0xSplits is designed to be as composable as possible, making it easy to use your
Splits with third party platforms. Below are a few platforms on which people are
using Splits today.

### OpenSea

When creating a collection on OpenSea, you can add creator earnings (i.e.
royalties) and specify the address to which the earnings will be sent. OpenSea‚Äôs
instructions are
[here](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500009575482-How-do-creator-earnings-work-on-OpenSea-).
Just paste in your Split's address into the "Creator Earnings" section. Note:
you can split Creator Earnings directly on OpenSea, however, this will make it
[more expensive](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500011590241-What-are-service-and-creator-fees-#:~:text=Splitting%20creator%20fees)
for the buyer each time your NFT is sold.

At this time, OpenSea does not allow setting a Creator Earnings for an
individual item. Creator Earnings can
[only be added](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500011590241-What-are-service-and-creator-fees-#:~:text=at%20any%20time.-,Creator%20fees,-Creators%20can%20set)
at the Collection level. In the future, we hope to see more platforms follow
[Zora‚Äôs approach](https://zine.zora.co/zora-v3) in letting creators specify a
‚Äúfunds recipient‚Äù field on a per-item basis.

### Zora

Zora‚Äôs [V3 contracts](https://zine.zora.co/zora-v3) allow for developers to
specify a ‚Äúseller funds recipient‚Äù. This is the address that funds are sent to
once the NFT is sold. All you have to do is set the
[`sellerFundsRecipient`](https://docs.zora.co/docs/smart-contracts/modules/Asks/zora-v3-asks-v1.1#ask-structure)
to be the Split's address.

At this time, Zora
[does not allow](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/5577498-revenue-splits) a
person to specify this address through their app/interface directly. In the
meantime, you can use the Etherscan UI to create a new Zora listing and set a
Split as the funds recipient.

### Foundation

While creating a NFT on Foundation, creators can optionally split earnings for
that NFT with up to 3 other addresses natively through Foundation. Instructions
are
[here](https://help.foundation.app/hc/en-us/articles/4513530159131-Splitting-Earnings-on-an-NFT).
Using 0xSplits within Foundation is easy ‚Äì just paste your Split‚Äôs address into
the recipient field while creating a Foundation split.

Why use 0xSplits within Foundation? Though conceptually they may seem similar,
functionally 0xSplits and Foundation splits are quite different.

- 0xSplits have mutability, allowing you to change the recipients & percentages
  in the future without having to mint a new NFT contract.
- 0xSplits are not tied to any one particular NFT contract or platform. They can
  be reused again and again across any platform. This means you can use the
  exact same Split on OpenSea, Zora, Foundation, Manifold, etc.
- 0xSplits allow for up to ~500 recipients, whereas Foundation limits you to 4
  recipients (including yourself). This is because on Foundation the split logic
  happens each time the NFT is sold, passing on that cost to the buyer.
- 0xSplits splitting logic is batched & exists as a standalone function that is
  handled by bots/third parties. The cost of splitting on Foundation is paid for
  by the buyer each time the NFT changes hands.

All this is not to say 0xSplits is better than Foundation splits! They're very
different and were each designed with different constraints in mind. and The
best tool for the job depends on the job itself. We encourage you to learn about
the tradeoffs of each option, and reach out if you have any questions.

### Manifold

Manifold makes it super easy for people to set royalties on their NFT contracts.
Their approach is very similar to Foundation's, and it's worth reading the above
section if you haven't already. You can read Manifold's instructions
[here](https://docs.manifold.xyz/v/manifold-studio/deploying-contracts/royalties).
To use 0xSplits on Manifold, just enter the Split's address in the "Default
Royalties" section.

It's also worth nothing that Manifold allows you to _mint NFTs_, meaning what
you configure on Manifold relates only to _secondary sales_. To split _primary
sales_ revenue from a Manifold NFT, check out
[this guide](https://mirror.xyz/iamkabuki.eth/CKikAuMK71sdfrfDb5qUb-Hwp-PwbhC0v2muIUyCcm0).
