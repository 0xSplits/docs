# Using A Split

Just like any other payable smart contract, each Split has a unique address at
which it can receive funds. Funds can be sent from any exchange, marketplace,
wallet, or smart contract, including those with hard gas limits. Splits can only
distribute ETH and ERC20 tokens. NFTs & other tokens sent to a Split will be
**permanently lost**.

  Do not send NFTs to a Split - only send ETH and ERC20s.

You can locate a Split's address by viewing its detail page within the app.
[Here is an example](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF8843981e7846945960f53243cA2Fd42a579f719/).
The Split's address is displayed 1) in the URL of the page itself, and 2) within
the "Address" section in the upper right of the page. Any ETH & ERC20s sent to
this address will be split among the recipients.

To find a specific Split, you can search by pressing `/` anywhere within the app
(or by hitting 🔍 in the nav). If you're unable to locate a Split but know one
of the recipients, just search for their ENS/address and then look for the split
in the "Receiving From" section on the right side of the page.

## Third Party Platforms

0xSplits is designed to be as composable as possible, making it very easy to use
your Splits with third party platforms. Below are a few platforms on which
people are using Splits today.

### OpenSea

When creating a collection on OpenSea, you can add a creator fee and specify the
address to which the creator fee will be sent. OpenSea’s instructions are
[here](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500009575482-How-do-creator-fees-work-on-OpenSea).
In the final step, just paste your Split’s address into the “payout address”
field. All future creator fees will automatically be sent to the Split, and then
distributed among the Recipients.

At this time, OpenSea does not allow setting a payout address for an individual
item. Creator fees, and the associated payout address, can
[only be added](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500011590241-What-are-OpenSea-s-fees-#:~:text=%C2%A0-,Splitting%20Revenue,-If%20you%20are)
at the Collection level. In the future, we hope to see more platforms follow
[Zora’s approach](https://zine.zora.co/zora-v3) in letting creators specify a
“funds recipient” field on a per-item basis.

### Zora

Zora’s [V3 contracts](https://zine.zora.co/zora-v3) allow for developers to
specify a “seller funds recipient”. This is the address that funds are sent to
once the NFT is sold. All you have to do is set the
[`sellerFundsRecipient`](https://docs.zora.co/docs/smart-contracts/modules/Asks/zora-v3-asks-v1.1#ask-structure)
to be the Split's address.

As of writing, Zora
[does not allow](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/5577498-revenue-splits) a
person to specify this address through their app/interface directly. In the
meantime, you can use the Etherscan UI to create a new Zora listing and set a
Split as the funds recipient.

### Foundation

While creating a NFT on Foundation, creators can optionally split earnings for
that NFT with up to 3 other addresses natively through Foundation. Instructions
are
[here](https://help.foundation.app/en/articles/5305276-how-can-i-create-a-split-on-foundation).
Using 0xSplits within Foundation is easy - just paste your Split’s address into
the recipient field while creating a Foundation split.

Why use 0xSplits within Foundation? Though conceptually the outcome may seem
similar—automatically split secondary royalties—functionally 0xSplits and
Foundation splits are very different. Most of these differences come down to the
fact that a Split created using 0xSplits is a _stand alone smart contract_,
whereas a split created on Foundation (or Manifold) lives within that NFT
contract. More specifically:

- 0xSplits have mutability, allowing you to change the split percentages in the
  future without having to mint a new NFT contract.
- 0xSplits can be used across any marketplace or platform simultaneously. This
  means you can use the exact same Split on OpenSea that you do on
  Foundation/Manifold/etc.
- 0xSplits allow for vastly more recipients (~500 as of writing). Currently,
  Foundation limits you to 4 total recipients (including yourself). This
  constraint is primarily driven by gas consumption, since adding recipients _to
  the NFT directly_ increases gas cost not only for minting the NFT, but each
  time it's sold as well.

You can learn more about Foundation's splits
[here](https://help.foundation.app/en/collections/3010288-splits). The best tool
for the job depends on the job itself. We encourage you to learn about the
tradeoffs of each option, and reach out if you have any questions.

### Manifold

Manifold makes it super easy for people to set royalties on their NFT contracts.
Their approach is very similar to Foundation's, and it's worth reading the above
section if you haven't already. You can read Manifold's instructions
[here](https://docs.manifold.xyz/deploying-contracts/royalties). To use 0xSplits
on Manifold, just enter the Split's address in the "Default Royalties" section.

It's also worth nothing that Manifold allows people to _mint NFTs_, meaning what
you configure on Manifold relates to _secondary sales_, not primary sales. To
split revenue from _primary sales_, we recommend using Zora's contracts as they
offer the most flexibility, specifically around setting the "funds recipient".
