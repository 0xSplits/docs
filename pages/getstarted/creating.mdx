# Creating A Split

Go to [split.new](https://split.new) and add each
[Recipient](/core-concepts#recipient)'s address (ENS or hex) and their
correspdong share. A Recipient can be any payable Ethereum address – user
wallets, smart contracts, and other Splits are all valid Recipients. Make sure
ownership adds to 100%, approve the transaction, and you're done.

You can also create a Split by pasting or uploading a CSV. Lines should be
separated by a comma, with each line containing a single Recipient and their
corresponding share (also comma-separated). Hit "Validate list" to make sure
there are no errors before submitting your transaction.

There are two optional parameters when creating a Split: setting a distributor
fee, and making the Split mutable.

### Distributor Fee

This is the percentage of the balance rewarded to whoever distributes the
balance. This fee creates an arbitrage opportunity—when the cost to distribute
is less than the fee multiplied by the balance—thereby incentivizing third
parties to distribute balances on behalf of Recipients. You can think of this as
a payment processing fee paid for proportionally by Recipients. A higher fee
leads to more frequent distributions, but results in a smaller balance going to
Recipients. Setting the fee to 0% removes the reward entirely.

### Mutable

A Mutable Split is one that can be modified in the future by a single
controlling address. As the creator of a Mutable Split, you must specify the
controlling address at the time of creation. The controlling address can can be
any valid account (EOA or SC), but make sure it's able to approve transactions
so it can interact with the Split directly. While Mutable Splits add more
flexiblity, they inherently require more trust. Mutable Splits can be made
immutable, but never the other way around.

## Calling the Contracts

Creating a Split from another product/app is easy. All you have to do is call
[`createSplit`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain#createsplit) on `SplitMain`. A
high-level overview of the contracts & functions can be found
[here](/smartcontracts/overview). For implementation details, you can check out
the Natspec Comments for [`SplitMain`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain) and
[`SplitWallet`](/smartcontracts/SplitWallet), or view the contracts directly on
[GitHub](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-contracts).
