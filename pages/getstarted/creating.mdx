To get started head to [split.new](https://split.new) and select "Split" from
the new contract page. There are 3 types of Splits you can create.

- Immutable Split: the Recipients are permanently fixed and can never be changed
  by anyone
- Mutable Split: the Controlling Address may change the Split at any time
- Liquid Split: each Recipient can manage their ownership in the Split using
  NFTs

### Recipients

Once you've selected the Split type, you can enter in each Recipient's address
(ENS or hex) and their corresponding ownership. Since a Recipient doesn't need
to withdraw for itself, you may enter any payable addressâ€”user wallets, smart
contracts, and other Splits are all acceptable.

### Distribution Incentive

This is the percent of the Split's balance paid to whoever distributes it. You
can think of it as a "payment processing fee". Leaving this to a positive number
allows your Split to be "automated" since it creates an incentive for third
parties to distribute balances for Recipients. By default this is set to 1% but
you may remove it (by setting it to 0%) or increase it (the maximum is 10%).

**Tip:** Once you've filled out the Recipients section, you will see an estimate
of when it becomes profitable for a third party to distribute the funds for
Recipients. If you're not sure what value to use, we recommend leaving it at the
default setting of 1.00%. [Learn more](/core-concepts#distributor-fee)

### Controlling Address

This section only applies to Mutable Splits. The Controlling Address has the
ability to modify the Recipients, Distribution Incentive, Controlling Address,
and even make the Split immutable. The Controlling Address may be any account
(EOA, Gnosis Safe, smart contract, etc).

### Contract Address

This section only applies to Immutable Splits. The Contract Address is the
address at which this Immutable Split, according to the Recipients and
Distribution Incentive set above, will be deployed. This address will change if
you update the Recipients or Distribution Incentive. You may send
crytocurrencies to this address prior to creating the Split, however, to
withdraw tokens the Split will need to be deployed.
