# Creating A Split

Creating a Split only takes a few seconds. Just navigate to the
[New Split](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/split/) page, and add each
[Owner](/core-concepts#owner)'s address (ENS or hex) and their portion of the
Split. An Owner can be _any_ valid Ethereum address â€“ user wallets, smart
contracts, and other Splits are all valid Owners. Make sure ownership adds to
100%, confirm the transaction, and you're done! ðŸŽ‰

Once your Split has been created, any ETH or ERC20s sent to its address will be
distributed among the Owners, forever, without you having to do anything. You
can read more about using Splits in platforms like OpenSea, Foundation, and
others [here](/getstarted/using).

There are two optional parameters when creating a Split:

1. You can change the [Splitter Fee](/core-concepts#splitter-fee). This fee
   incentivizes third parties to distribute the
   [balance](/core-concepts#balance) on behalf of Owners. The fee can be 0-10%.
   A higher fee leads to more frequent distributions, but it reduces the amount
   each Owner receives since it's deducted from the balance. You can think of
   this fee as a tax Owners pay in exchange for having their balance
   distributed.

2. You can make it a [Mutable Split](/core-concepts#mutable-split). To do this,
   just toggle the Mutable switch and specify the address that can control the
   Split. This address defaults to your own address, but can be any valid
   Ethereum address (EOA or SC). Though Mutable Splits add more flexiblity, they
   require more trust and should be used with caution.

  We are particularly excited about the potential for custom smart contracts
  that can modify Splits based on other onchain data. Please reach out if you're
  interested in this â€“ we'd like to explore this concept & support you however
  we can!

### Calling the Contracts

Creating a Split from another product/app is easy. All you have to do is call
[`createSplit`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain#createsplit) on `SplitMain` and pass
through the params (accounts, ownerships, Splitter Fee, etc). A high-level
overview of the contracts & functions can be found
[here](/smartcontracts/overview). For implementation details, you can check out
the Natspec Comments for [`SplitMain`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain) and
[`SplitWallet`](/smartcontracts/SplitWallet), or view the contracts directly on
[GitHub](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits/tree/master/contracts).
