# Creating A Split

## Using the App

Creating a Split only takes a few seconds. Just navigate to the
[New Split](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/split/) page, and add each
[Owner](/core-concepts#owner)'s address (ENS or hex) and their portion of the
Split. An Owner can be _any_ valid Ethereum address â€“ user wallets, smart
contracts, and other Splits are all valid Owners. Make sure ownership adds to
100%, confirm the transaction, and you're done! ðŸŽ‰

Once your Split has been created, any ETH or ERC20s sent to its address will be
distributed among the Owners, forever, without you having to do anything. You
can read more about using Splits in other platforms like OpenSea, Foundation,
and others [here](/getstarted/using).

There are two optional parameters when creating a Split:

1. You can change the [Splitter Fee](/core-concepts#splitter-fee). The Splitter
   Fee incentivizes third parties to distribute the
   [balance](/core-concepts#balance) on behalf of Owners. The fee can be 0-10%.
   A higher fee leads to more frequent distributions, but it reduces the amount
   each Owner receives since it's deducted from the balance.

2. You can make it a [Mutable Split](/core-concepts#mutable-split). To do this,
   just toggle the Mutable switch and specify the address that can control the
   Split. This address defaults to your own address, and can be any EOA or SC.

  We're particularly excited about the potential for custom smart contracts
  being able to modify Splits based on other onchain data. Please reach out if
  you're interested in this - we'd like to help!

## Calling the Contracts

You can call the contracts directly if you want to integrate 0xSplits into your
own product. To create a Split, all you have to do is call
[`createSplit`](/natspec/SplitMain#createsplit) on
[`SplitMain`](/smart-contracts#splitmain). A high-level overview of the
contracts & functions can be found [here](/smart-contracts). For more details,
check out [Natspec Comments](/natspec/SplitMain) or the
[GitHub](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits).
