# Creating Splits

  Contracts](/smartcontracts/overview) and [SDK](/sdk) sections.

To get started head to [split.new](https://split.new) (or hit the âž• button in
the nav) and just add each [Recipient](/core-concepts#recipient)'s address (ENS
or hex) and their corresponding share. Since Recipients don't need to withdraw
for themselves, a Recipient can be any payable Ethereum addressâ€”user wallets,
smart contracts, and other Splits are all acceptable.

There are two additional parameters you can (optionally) modify: the
Distribution Incentive, and the Split Type.

### Distribution Incentive

This allows Splits to be distributed automatically, without you or any of the
Recipients having to worry about it. The incentive is the percent of the balance
rewarded to whoever pays the gas needed to distribute the balance. This creates
an arbitrage opportunity (when the cost to distribute is less than the reward),
which causes bots & third parties to automatically distribute balances for
Recipients. Balances must only be distributed once for all Recipients to claim
their share.

**Tip:** Once you've filled out the Recipients section, we give you an estimate
of when a bot/third will distribute the balance (i.e., when it's profitable for
_anyone_ to distribute the funds for Recipients). If you're not sure what value
to use, we recommend leaving it at the default setting of 1.00%.

### Split Type

Splits can either be Immutable (the default option) or Mutable. Once deployed,
Immutable Splits can never be changed by anyone. Mutable Splits, on the other
hand, can be changed at any time by the Controller. The Controller has the
ability to modify the Recipients and Distribution Incentive, and even transfer
control to someone else or remove the Controller entirely (thereby making the
Split Immutable). The Controller can be any account (EOA, multisig, smart
contract with custom logic, etc). [Learn more](/core-concepts#mutable-split)

Keep in mind that larger Splits will require more gas. Mutable Splits will also
require slightly more gas to deploy. Gas estimates can be found
[here](/appendices/gas-estimates).
