# Creating A Split

Creating a Split only takes a few seconds. Just head to
[split.new](https://split.new) and add each
[Recipient](/core-concepts#recipient)'s address (ENS or hex) and their portion
of the Split. A Recipient can be _any_ valid Ethereum address â€“ user wallets,
smart contracts, and other Splits are all valid Recipients. Make sure ownership
adds to 100%, confirm the transaction, and you're done! ðŸŽ‰

You can also create Splits by pasting or uploading a CSV. Just select the "CSV
Upload" tab and enter each Recipient and share on it's own line. Hit "Validate
list" to make sure there are no errors and then deploy your Split.

Once your Split has been created, any ETH or ERC20s sent to its address will be
distributed among the Recipients, forever, without you having to do anything.
You can read more about using Splits in platforms like OpenSea, Foundation, and
others [here](/getstarted/using).

There are two optional parameters when creating a Split:

1. You can change the [Distributor Fee](/core-concepts#distributor-fee). This
   fee incentivizes third parties to distribute the
   [balance](/core-concepts#balance) on behalf of Recipients. The fee can be
   0-10%. A higher fee leads to more frequent distributions, but it reduces the
   amount each Recipient receives since it's deducted from the balance. You can
   think of this fee as a tax Recipients pay in exchange for having their
   balance distributed.

2. You can make it a [Mutable Split](/core-concepts#mutable-split). To do this,
   just toggle the Mutable switch and specify the address of the Controller. The
   Controller has the ability to modify the Split in the future. It defaults to
   your own address, but can be any valid Ethereum address (EOA or SC). Though
   Mutable Splits add more flexiblity, they require more trust and should be
   used with caution.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ‘¾">
  We're excited about the idea of building smart contracts that can modify
  Splits based on other onchain state. Please reach out if you're interested in
  this â€“ we'd like to explore this concept & support you however we can!

### Calling the Contracts

Creating a Split from another product/app is easy. All you have to do is call
[`createSplit`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain#createsplit) on `SplitMain` and pass
through the params (recipients, ownerships, distributor fee, etc). A high-level
overview of the contracts & functions can be found
[here](/smartcontracts/overview). For implementation details, you can check out
the Natspec Comments for [`SplitMain`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain) and
[`SplitWallet`](/smartcontracts/SplitWallet), or view the contracts directly on
[GitHub](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-contracts).
