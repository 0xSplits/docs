# Alternative Solutions

We drew considerable inspiration from [Mirror](https://dev.mirror.xyz/V_7Jp1hy_g8bz-J1B4Wb5KYSmj5Lt4W7q7cw0noxJsU) and a few others in this space.
We focused on 3 key differentiating areas when designing this protocol: composability, gas efficiency & fairness, and onchain-ness.

Below we highlight some key differences between Splits and other implementations of splitter contracts.

## Mirror

### Composability

- Splits can receive from solidity's `send` / `transfer` or from `call` with capped gas
- Splits handles ERC20s & recursive Splits
- Splits can withdraw to contracts that use more than 30k gas in `receive()`
- Splits can withdraw to contracts/accounts that don't have direct access to the private keys using [`withdrawFor`](/smart-contracts#withdrawforaddress)

### Gas-efficiency

- Splits is ~5x for more efficient for Splits < 500; ~2.5x for > 500 (2-layer Split)
- Splits is significantly more gas efficient for users in multiple Splits, since each Mirror split must be claimed individually

### Gas-fairness

- Splits are progressive or flat depending on the Splitter Fee, whereas Mirror splits are regressive
- Splits generates significantly less dust (e.g. funds trapped because of gas costs to distribute)

### Onchain-ness

- Mirror posts a merkle root onchain but owners & ownerships live offchain

## OZ PaymentSplitter

### Gas-efficiency

- Splits costs **significantly** less to deploy
- Splits is more gas efficient to distribute

### Gas-fairness

- OZ PaymentSplitter splits are regressive
