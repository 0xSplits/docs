# Vesting Module

The Vesting Module allows multiple, isolated streams of different tokens to be
vested to a beneficiary over a set period of time. All streams within a vesting
module share a vesting period, but each stream may begin vesting or release
tokens independently.

## How It Works

- Each vesting module has a payable address to which ETH and ERC20 tokens can be
  sent.
- Tokens sent to the vesting module are held until a vesting stream for a
  specific token is started. Streams are token-specific, and multiple streams
  may occur simultaneously.
- Once a stream has begun, the vested portion can be transferred from the
  vesting contract to the beneficiary.

## How To Use

1. Navigate to an existing split's detail page and hit "New Vesting Module"
   within the Address section.
2. A form will appear with the beneficiary's address pre-filled to the current
   split's address. Enter the vesting period (in days) and approve the
   transaction.
3. Once the transaction has been confirmed, you'll see the vesting module listed
   in the Address section under "Vesting Modules" on the split detail page.
4. Click on the vesting module's address and send tokens to it like you would a
   split.
5. Tokens received by the vesting module are held in a "Pending" section until a
   stream has begun. Each token will have it's own unique stream, however,
   multiple deposits can occur before a stream begins. You may wish to wait
   until a ~meaningful balance accrues before starting the stream.
6. Once a stream has begun and tokens have vested, select the streams to release
   and click "Release Streams". Once the transaction is confirmed, the vested
   tokens will be sent to the split (the beneficiary).
7. From here you can interact with the split as you normally would. You can
   navigate to the split's detail page and select the balance(s) to distribute
   to the recipients, or wait for the system to do that automatically (assuming
   a distributor fee has been set).

## Notes

- This module is designed to be used in conjunction with a mutable Split. You
  may use it with an immutable split, however, vesting tokens to an immutable
  split is equivalent to sending all tokens in one lump sum.
- This module is immutable. Once it's been created, it cannot be changed.
- Multiple vesting modules can point to the same beneficiary, however, each
  vesting module must be unique. No two vesting modules can have identical
  beneficiaries _and_ vesting periods.
