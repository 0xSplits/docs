# Recoup

The Recoup template allows you to repay one group before splitting profits with
another. It's a wrapper contract that allows you to create a
[Waterfall](/modules/waterfall) that points to a number of
[Splits](/smartcontracts/overview).

## How It Works

- Go to [app.0xsplits.xyz/new/recoup](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/new/recoup/) and
  enter in the token and amount you wish to recoup. In the "Recipient(s)"
  section, if you want split the recoup amount with a number of accounts just
  hit "Add Recipient" (just like when [creating a Split](/getstarted/creating)).
  As long as more than one recipient is added, a Split will be automatically
  created alongside the Recoup.

- You can also add a controller and modify the distribution incentive if you'd
  like. By default, we do not set a controller (i.e., the Split is immutable)
  and we set the distribution incentive to be 1% so that balances are
  automatically distributed. You may override these as you wish.
- Once you hit Create Recoup, you will be brought to the Recoup detail page
  where you can see how much of the recoup has been paid back, and who the
  recipients are for each tier. On the right side, you can see the Recoup's
  earnings and any current balances.

## Notes

- We recommend familiarizing yourself with how [Waterfall](/modules/waterfall)
  and [Splits](/smartcontracts/overview) work, since Recoup is just a basic
  wrapper for those two contracts.
- Any non-permitted tokens sent to the Recoup will be recovered to the Profit
  Share Tier.
- Recoup is an immutable contract. Once it's been created, it cannot be changed.
