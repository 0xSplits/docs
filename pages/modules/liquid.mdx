This module uses NFTs to represent ownership in a Split. Recipients are
automatically updated according to the percent of NFT Total Supply each
Recipient owns. To accomplish this, an NFT contract is the Controller of a
Mutable Split. Tokens are sent to the NFT contract, and when released to the
Split, the Recipients are updated and tokens are distributed.

## How It Works

- Each Liquid Module has a payable address to which ETH and ERC20 tokens can be
  sent.
- Each Liquid Module has a Total Supply of NFTs, where each NFT represents the
  corresponding percent ownership in the Split. For example: a Total Supply of
  50 means each NFT represents 2% ownership in the Split, since `100 / 50 = 2`.
- Tokens sent to the Liquid Module are held until the balance is released to the
  Split. Two things happen when tokens are released. First, the Split Recipients
  are updated according to each Recipient's balance (as a percentage) of Total
  Supply. Second, the tokens sitting in the Liquid Module are sent to the Split
  and immediately distributed to the Recipients.

## Notes

- Tokens should only be sent to the Liquid Module's address, not the Split
  directly. There is no guarantee that tokens sent to the Split directly will be
  distributed among current NFT holders. This is because the Liquid Module calls
  [`updateAndDistribute`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain#updateanddistributeeth) on
  when transfering tokens to the Split, which ensures the Recipients accurately
  reflect current NFT holders prior to each distribution.
- A higher Total Supply means higher distribution costs, since on each
  distribution the Liquid Module looks for all accounts holding at least 1 NFT
  and then updates the Split accordingly. Given Split Recipients shouldn't
  exceed ~500 in aggregate, Total Supply should not be meaningfully higher
  (unless you expect a fairly concentrated distribution of NFTs). If the number
  of NFT holders exceeds the maximum number of Recipients in a Split (~500),
  tokens sitting in the Liquid Module will be locked until the number of NFT
  holders falls below that threshold. See
  [Gas Estimates](/appendices/gas-estimates#total-gas) to understand expected
  distribution costs.
- Total Supply must be greater than 1.
