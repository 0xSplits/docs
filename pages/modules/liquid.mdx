# Liquid Splits

Unlike standard Splits where ownership is controlled, Liquid Splits use NFTs to
represent ownership. This gives control of the Split to recipients themselves by
allowing them to easily transfer shares, either wholly or partially, to anyone
else.

## How It Works

- Each Liquid Split is comprised of an NFT contract and a mutable Split. When a
  Liquid Split is created, first an ERC-1155 contract is created and then a
  mutable Split is created where the Controlling Address is the 1155 contract.
  1,000 NFTs are then minted from the 1155 contract to the initial recipients.
- Each Liquid Split is a payable smart contract to which ETH and ERC20 tokens
  may be sent.
- Tokens sent to the Liquid Split are held until the balance is distributed.
- When a balance is distributed, in one transaction the Split recipients are
  updated to match the current NFT holders and the balance is distributed to
  those recipients. This way, the owneres of the NFTs at time of distribution
  will receive their share of the balance.

## How To Use

- Create a new Liquid Split by selecting it as the Split type on the new Split
  form. Add recipients and a distribution incentive, and then hit Create Split.
- Once the transaction has been confirmed, you'll be redirected to the Liquid
  Split's page. Subgraph may take a few minutes to update, so if this redirect
  doesn't happen automatically, you can locate the Liquid Split's page by
  searching for one of the recipients and looking at their "Receiving" section.
- On the Liquid Split page you can see the earnings, the address to which funds
  can be sent, and the current NFT holders. In the Holders section, next to each
  recipient's name you will see the total number of NFTs they hold and their
  corresponding share of the Split. Whenever the Liquid Split NFTs change hands,
  the holders will be automatically updated.
- Tokens sent to the Liquid Split are held as a balance until they're
  distributed. You can see the Liquid Split's balance and distributions in the
  Liquid Split section. Hitting "Distribute Funds" will update the Split (to
  match current NFT holders) and distribute the balance in a single transaction.

## Notes

- We recommend setting the distribution incentive on Liquid Splits to be
  slightly higher (i.e., ~2-3%) than on standard Splits. This is because
  distributions require more gas given the need to both update and distribute
  the Split.
- Liquid Split NFTs should only be considered to represent tokens that have not
  yet been received by the Split. Because recipients of a Liquid Split are
  updated at the time of a distribution, do not assume that by acquiring Liquid
  Split NFTs you will be entitled to any portion of the current balance. A
  nefarious seller could easily distribute the balance right before transferring
  the shares, causing them to receive that portion of balance.
- Since there are 1,000 NFTs for each Liquid Split, ownership can be defined to
  a tenth of a percent (one decimal place) vs traditional Splits, which can be
  defined to the hundreth of a percent (two decimal places).
- The ERC-1155 standard was used because it allows batch transfers. This means
  that someone can transfer 1% of the Split (i.e., 10 NFTs) in a single
  transaction, instead of 10 separate ones (which would be required if using the
  ERC-721 standard).
