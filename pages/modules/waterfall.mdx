# Waterfall

This module makes it easy to distribute funds to different recipients in a
particular order. It's useful when you want to send someone a certain amount
_before_ sending to someone else. Here's a simple example with 3 recipients:

> Send the first 100 USDC to bob.eth, then the next 50 USDC to mary.eth, and
> then send all remaining USDC to theprotocolguild.eth.

Waterfalls are payable smart contracts that compose well with Splits and other
platforms and contracts.

## How It Works

- Each Waterfall is a payable smart contract to which a Permitted Token (ETH or
  any ERC20) can be sent. Non-permitted ERC20 tokens can be [recovered](#notes).
- Each Waterfall has 2 or more Tranches. Each Tranche has a Threshold (a number)
  and a Recipient (an address). The last Tranche has no Threshold since it will
  receive all residual funds.
- Tokens sent to the Waterfall are held until the balance is distributed. When
  this happens, each Tranche pays out to the Recipient only once the preceding
  Tranche Threshold has been reached. This repeats until the all Tranches have
  been filled, at which point all residual funds are sent to the residual
  Tranche Recipient.

## How To Use

- Create a new Waterfall by entering in the Permitted Token address, and a
  Threshold and Recipient for each Tranche. You may add as many Tranches as you
  wish (more Tranches will be more expensive). Double check everything is right
  (these are immutable) and hit Create Waterfall.
- Once the transaction has been confirmed, you'll be redirected to the
  Waterfall's account page. If this doesn't happen, you can locate it by
  searching for one of the Recipients (it will show up their "Receiving" tab).
- Tokens received by the Waterfall are held as a balance until they're
  distributed. The Earnings section contains the Waterfall's balance and past
  distributions. Hitting "Distribute Funds" will send each Recipient their
  funds.
- If the Waterfall has received non-permitted tokens, they will show up below
  the Address section. You can recover these tokens to any of the Recipients
  using Etherscan (see [Notes](#notes)).
- Once all Tranche Thresholds have been filled, all remaining funds will be sent
  to the Recipient of the last Tranche (i.e., the residual).

## Notes

- Any non-permitted tokens sent to the Waterfall may be recovered to any of the
  recipients. To do so, open the Waterfall contract's "Write as Proxy" tab on
  Etherscan (you may first need to verify the proxy) and paste in the required
  fields, which can be copied from the Waterfall's account page on
  [app.0xsplits.xyz](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/).
- This is an immutable contract. Once it's been created, it cannot be changed.
- Funds flow unidirectionally and tranches do not reset, meaning the only way to
  "restart" the sequence is to create a new Waterfall. Unlike Splits, identical
  Waterfall contracts are permitted.
