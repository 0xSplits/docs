# Waterfall

> Send the first $100 to bob.eth, then the next $50 to mary.eth, and then all
> residual to yoursplit.eth

The Waterfall module makes it easy to set the order in which funds are
distributed to different recipients. It's useful when you want to pay one party
a certain amount _before_ paying another party. Waterfalls are payable smart
contracts that compose well with Splits and other contracts. This is an old
concept that has many different names—preference stack, seniority structure,
distribution waterfall, recoupment—and the Waterfall module brings this logic
onchain.

## How It Works

- Each Waterfall is a payable smart contract to which a Permitted Token may be
  sent. This token can be ETH or any ERC20 token. Non-permitted tokens sent to
  the Waterfall can be [recovered](#notes) to any of the Recipients.
- Each Waterfall has 2 or more Tranches. Each Tranche has a Threshold (a number)
  and a Recipient (an address). The last Tranche has no Threshold (i.e., upper
  limit) and will receive all residual funds.
- Tokens sent to the Waterfall are held as a balance until it's distributed.
  During a distribution, each Tranche sends funds to the Recipient only once the
  preceding Tranche Threshold has been reached. This repeats until the all
  Tranches have been filled, at which point all residual funds are sent to the
  residual Tranche Recipient.

## How To Use

- Create a new Waterfall by selecting which ERC20 token should be permitted.
  Then, for each Tranche add a Threshold and Recipient. You may add as many
  Tranches as you wish. Double check everything is right (these are immutable!)
  and hit Create Waterfall.
- Once the transaction has been confirmed, you'll be redirected to the
  Waterfall's account page. If this doesn't happen, you can locate it by
  searching for one of the Recipients and looking at their "Receiving" section.
- Tokens sent to the Waterfall are held as a balance until they're distributed.
  You can see the Waterfall's balance and distributions in the Earnings section.
  Hitting "Distribute Funds" will send each Recipient their funds.
- If the Waterfall has received non-permitted tokens, they will show up below
  the Address section. You can [recover](#notes) these tokens to any of the
  Recipients using Etherscan.
- Once all Tranche Thresholds have been filled, all remaining funds will be sent
  to the Recipient of the last Tranche (i.e., the residual).

## Notes

- Any non-permitted tokens sent to the Waterfall may be recovered to any of the
  Recipients. To do so, open the Waterfall contract's "Write as Proxy" tab on
  Etherscan (you may first need to verify the proxy) and paste in the required
  fields, which can be copied from the Waterfall's account page on
  [app.0xsplits.xyz](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/). **Note:** the Recipient does
  not need to initiate this call themselves, however, the account you're
  recovering funds to _must_ be one of the Tranche Recipients.
- The Waterfall is an immutable contract. Once it's been created, it cannot be
  changed. However, you can create a Waterfall that distributes to an existing
  Waterfall.
- Funds flow unidirectionally and Tranches do not reset, meaning the only way to
  "restart" the sequence is to create a new Waterfall.
