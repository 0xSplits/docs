# Modules

Modules are smart contracts that extend the functionality of the 0xSplits
protocol. The modules included in these docs were built by the 0xSplits team and
are all available in the [app](https://app.0xsplits.xyz), however, anyone can
create their own modules since they exist independently of the protocol. Drop us
a note to share what you've built, we'd love see how you're extending Splits.

- [Waterfall](/modules/waterfall) – set the order in which different accounts
  get paid; works well with Splits & Mutable Splits
- [Vesting](/modules/vesting) – stream multiple, isolated streams of tokens to
  an address over a set period of time; works well with Mutable Splits

These modules all started as ideas from the community so let us know what else
you'd to see included. You can reach out on the `dev-support` channel in Discord
if you have questions or want to discuss ways to integrate.
