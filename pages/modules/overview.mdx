# Modules

Modules are smart contracts that extend the functionality of the protocol. They
exist independently of 0xSplits, and operate either above or below the protocol.

Above the protocol modules execute logic _before_ tokens are sent to the split.
This means tokens must be sent to the module directly instead of the split. For
example, a vesting module vests tokens _before_ sending the vested portion to a
split. Tokens get sent to the vesting module, and from the vesting module to the
split.

Below the protocol modules execute logic _after_ tokens have been sent to a
split. For example, an NFT pointer module allows split recipients to change
based on NFT ownership. In this case, tokens are still sent to the split's
address—the logic only impacts how tokens are distributed within the split.

Most of these modules work independently of each other and can be combined to
match the specific workflow you have in mind. For example, vesting tokens to a
liquid split may be a great way to discourage quick flipping NFTs.

### Building Modules

Creating modules is permissionless since they exist independently of the
protocol itself. They're made possible due to the protocol's composability in
three key areas:

1. Receiving tokens: each split is a payable smart contract that can receive
   funds from any other account via `send`, `transfer`, or `call`.
2. Distributing tokens: each recipient can be an EOA or smart contract for which
   third parties may execute withdrawals.
3. Modifying recipients: the controller of a mutable split can also be an EOA or
   smart contract with custom logic.

All of the modules highlighted here have been suggestions from the community.
We'd love to see what modules you create, so please drop us a note in the
