# Modules

Modules are smart contracts that extend the functionality of the 0xSplits
protocol. They exist as independent contracts and operate either above or below
the protocol.

Above the protocol modules execute logic before tokens are sent to the Split.
This means tokens must be sent to the module directly _instead_ of the Split.
For example, a [Waterfall](/modules/waterfall) receives tokens, executes logic,
and then sends some portion to a Split. Tokens are first sent to the module, and
then the module sends tokens to the Split.

Below the protocol modules execute logic _after_ tokens have been sent to a
Split. For example, an NFT Pointer (Soon™️) allows a Split Recipient to match
whatever account owns a specific NFT. When the NFT changes hands, the Recipient
in the Split is updated. In this case, tokens are still sent to the Split
directly; the logic only impacts how tokens are distributed within the Split.

## Building Modules

Anyone can create modules since they exist independently of the protocol.
They're made possible due to the protocol's composability in three areas:

1. Receiving tokens: each Split is a payable smart contract that can receive
   funds from any other account via `send`, `transfer`, or `call`.
2. Withdrawing tokens: each Recipient can be an EOA or smart contract for which
   third parties may execute withdrawals.
3. Modifying recipients: the Controller of a Mutable Split can also be a smart
   contract, allowing Split recipients to be programatically updated according
   to predefined logic.

All modules highlighted in these docs started as ideas from the community. We'd
love to see the modules you create and learn about what ideas you have. Please
drop us a note in the `dev-support` channel in Discord if you have questions or
want to discuss ways to integrate your modules into the app.
