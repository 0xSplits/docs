# Modules

Modules are smart contracts that extend the functionality of the 0xSplits
protocol. They exist as independent contracts, and operate either above or below
the protocol.

Above the protocol modules execute logic _before_ tokens are sent to the Split.
This means tokens must be sent to the module directly instead of the Split. For
example, a [Vesting Module](/modules/overview) vests tokens _before_ sending the
vested portion to a Split. Tokens are first sent to the Mesting Module and then
to the Split.

Below the protocol modules execute logic _after_ tokens have been sent to a
Split. For example, a Pointer Module allows a Split Recipient to match whatever
account owns a specific NFT. When the NFT changes hands, the Recipient in the
Split is updated. In this case, tokens are still sent to the Split directly; the
logic only impacts how tokens are distributed within the Split.

Most of these modules work independently of each other and can be combined to
match the specific workflow you have in mind. For example, vesting tokens to a
Liquid Module may be a great way to discourage quick flipping NFTs, since the
NFTs (theoretically) deliver value to the current owner.

### Building Modules

Anyone can create modules since they exist independently of the protocol.
They're made possible due to the protocol's composability in three key areas:

1. Receiving tokens: each Split is a payable smart contract that can receive
   funds from any other account via `send`, `transfer`, or `call`.
2. Distributing tokens: each Recipient can be an EOA or smart contract for which
   third parties may execute withdrawals.
3. Modifying recipients: the Controller of a Mutable Split can also be an EOA or
   smart contract with custom logic.

All modules highlighted in these docs started as ideas from the community. We'd
love to see what modules you create, so please drop us a note in the
`#dev-support` channel in Discord if you have questions or want to discuss ways
to integrate your modules into the app.
