# When To Use

Splits are valuable whenever you want to allocate percentages of an onchain income to different parties. DAOs are incredibly powerful coordination tools, but we believe they can be too heavy for many smaller project & forms of cooperation (especially when the work has already been done). We want to see onchain collaboration flourish and believe a composable, recursive, gas-optimized splitter with a simple UI is an important missing primitive in the space.

A project that would benefit from using Splits is a group working together to launch an NFT. The proceeds from minting and later royalties from secondary trades can be pointed to a Split’s address. Each Owner then receives their portion of all future income. If the team's work was inspired by another project, they may also choose to make that project a small Owner in the Split as a way of giving back.

Another example might be a group of open source contributors who wish to receive onchain tips and donations. Rather than listing a single donation address and trusting one of the contributors to disperse the proceeds among the group, they may simply create a Split and have it receive the donations. All future donations will be automatically distributed amongst the contributors, without anyone having to lift a finger or operate in good faith.

Each Split is just a smart contract and can interact with any other smart contracts on both the inflow and outflow. We’re excited to see what interesting use cases emerge within the community over time.

## When To Not Use

- **Very large projects:** Splits are designed for groups of people less than ~500. While you can stack Splits multiple layers deep (i.e. Splits that point to other Splits), you should make sure enough funds will flow through the Split to limit earnings lost to gas. The larger the group, the more you should consider some kind of rebasing token or perhaps a DAO.

- **Single-use:** Splits are designed to be gas-optimized when receiving income over time. If the payout is expected to arrive in a single lump sum, a [multisend](https://disperse.app/) via a multisig may be more efficient.
