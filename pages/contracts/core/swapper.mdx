# Swapper

![Split diagram](./img/swapper_diagram.png)

Swapper is a payable smart contract that converts all incoming tokens into a
single output token. Whenever ETH and ERC20s are received by a Swapper, they're
automatically swapped into the output token according to the oracle's clearing
price.

## How it works

- Each Swapper is a payable smart contract with a specified beneficiary, output
  token (ETH or any ERC20), and oracle. The oracle is modular so be very careful
  to use a secure oracle with sensible defaults & overrides for desired
  behavior. 0xSplits currently offers one
  [oracle](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-oracle), which uses UniswapV3
  TWAP, but you can use whatever oracle you'd like as long as it complies with
  the
  [interface](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-oracle/blob/main/src/interfaces/IOracle.sol).
- Tokens received by Swapper are held in the contract's balance until `flash` is
  called. When `flash` is called, the caller sends the expected amount (as
  determined by the oracle) to the beneficiary in exchange for the balance in
  Swapper. This means _the caller is trading with Swapper directly_, earning the
  balance in exchange for sending the expected value to the beneficiary.
- Each Swapper can be owned, which means the **owner has full control of the
  deployment**. The owner may change the oracle, pause the contract, and execute
  arbitrary transactions at their will. We recommend removing the owner or
  making it a multisig if Swapper is being used in any trustless setting.
