# Introduction

0xSplits is a protocol for splitting onchain income. Its composable,
gas-efficient, and trustless. Its live [on Ropsten](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/)
and coming soon to Ethereum & EVM compatible chains.

At the core of the protocol are [Splits](/core-concepts/#split) and
[Owners](/core-concepts/#owner). A Split is a smart contract that receives and
distributes incoming funds to the Owners. An Owner is any address (externally
owned account or smart contract) that earns a portion of the Split's income.
When a Split earns income, each Owner receives their share.

### Features

- Splits are **fully composable** on both input & output. Each Split is a
  payable smart contract that can directly receive ETH & ERC20s from any EOA or
  SC. Each Owner is also just an Ethereum address (EOA or SC) for which
  third-parties may execute withdrawals. With full composability on both ends,
  Splits is an effective routing layer within any workflow.
- Splits maximize **gas efficiency** by batching expensive operations &
  commingling funds. Gas needed to distribute funds is borne by ownership or
  covered by a third party, eliminating dust and allowing even the smallest
  Owner to withdraw their funds.
- Each Split exists **entirely onchain** and the actions necessary for the
  protocol to operate are incentivized & permissionless. With no trusted third
  parties, infrastructure dependencies, or upgradable contracts, you can be sure
  each Split will continue to operate for as long as Ethereum exists.

### Usage

Splits are valuable whenever you want to allocate percentages of onchain income
to different parties. We believe a composable, gas-optimized, easy-to-use
splitter contract is an important primitive that will help usher in a new wave
of onchain collaboration & giving back. Here are a few ways 0xSplits is being
used:

- **Onchain Collaboration**: Income from minting NFTs & royalties from secondary
  sales can be pointed to a Split's address. From then on, each Owner will
  receive their portion of future income without the need for any manual
  multisends or ongoing maintenance. If the team's work was inspired by another
  project, they can make that project a small Owner in their Split as a way of
  giving back & saying thanks.
- **Giving Back**: Rather than listing a single donation address for an open
  source project, and trusting one of the contributors to disperse the proceeds,
  the developers may simply create a Split and have it receive the donations.
  All future donations will be automatically distributed amongst the
  contributors, without anyone having to manage it or trust one another. The
  developers may also make the Split mutable by a multisig, allowing them to add
  future collaborators to the Split.

### Community

0xSplits is a **public good that's free to use.** The protocol runs exactly at
gas cost and charges no fees whatsoever. It's designed to be a
[piece of infrastructure](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html) that can
run for free, forever, while creating value for network participants.

We believe that 0xSplits unlocks an interesting approach to continuously funding
public goods. And we're dogfooding out own protocol. If you'd like to support
this protocol, all you have to do is add
[0xsplits.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x50671995e1eca15ca9e807774a814331cabe0f3b)
as an Owner in the Splits you create. That account is itself a Split, which
donates to the communities that helped get us to launch.
