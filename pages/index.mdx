  Learn how to use 0xSplits to power onchain payments
</div>

0xSplits is a set of composable,
[open-source](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2ed6c4b5da6378c7897ac67ba9e43102feb694ee#code),
and
[audited](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-contracts/blob/main/audit/0xSplits_A-1.pdf)
smart contracts that make it easy to split onchain payments. Running exactly at
gas and charging no fees whatsoever, it takes the form of a
[hyperstructure](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html) that will run for
free, forever, without any maintenance or trusted third parties.

Each smart contract is a building block that composes well with other contracts
and the Ethereum ecosystem at large. By stacking contacts together, you're able
to create your own payment flow that plugs into whatever platforms you're using.

These docs are designed to become progressively more technical the further you
read. If you're non-technical, new to Ethereum, or just want to understand how
you can use 0xSplits today, we recommend you continue reading. If you're
integrating the contracts into your own system, you're welcome to skip ahead to
the [Developer tools](/dev) and [Contracts](/contracts) sections.

## Features

- No protocol fees whatsoever, just pay gas.
- [Audited](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-contracts/blob/main/audit/0xSplits_A-1.pdf),
  [open source](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-contracts), and
  [verified](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2ed6c4b5da6378c7897ac67ba9e43102feb694ee#code)
  contracts.
- Non-upgradable & entirely onchain contracts mean no breaking changes or
  third-party dependencies.
- Compatible with ETH & ERC-20 tokens, and live on most EVM chains: Ethereum,
  Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis, and most others.
- Maximally composable contracts that can be stacked upon one another, and
  permissionless withdrawals allow anyone to withdraw for other accounts.
- Highly gas efficient
- Automatic distributions using built-in incentives that encourage bots &
  third-parties to execute the most repetitve tasks.
- Withdrawals are batched, allowing recipients to claim their funds in a single
  transaction (not a multicall).

## Usage

Teams, platforms, and projects of all sizes trust 0xSplits to power their
payment flows.

- **Platforms**: Sound, SuperRare, Artblocks, Tessera, Arpeggi, Bonfire, Decent,
  1stDibs
- **Collectives**: Protocol Guild, Metalabel, Songcamp, Heds
- **Musicians**: Daniel Allan, Reo Cragun, Coop Records, Venice Music
- **DAOs**: Nouns, Airswap, Bankless

## Values

Our values guide how the system is built. We hope that publicly communicating
our values will give you a better understanding why the system is built the way
it is.

- Do one thing and do it well. Empowering creatives with simple, clear, and
  modular tools is the best way to create enduring value in the ecosystem.
- Trust is hard to build and easy to lose. Security of the system is the highest
  order bit, and the system is only as secure as the foundation upon which its
  built.
- Growing the pie matters more than growing the slice. Composability within the
  ecosystem is the lifeblood of growth since it's experimentation at the edges
  where the most compelling discoveries happen.
- Tools must be credibly neutral. This means they're rule-based, verifiable &
  open source, easy to understand, simple, and hard—if not impossible—to change.
