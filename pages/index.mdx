# 0xSplits

0xSplits is an easy-to-use, composable, and gas-efficient protocol for splitting
onchain income with multiple parties. It is
[live for testing](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/) on Ropsten & coming shortly to
Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains.

At the core of the protocol are [Splits](/core-concepts/#split) and
[Owners](/core-concepts/#owner). A Split is a smart contract that receives and
splits incoming funds to the Owners. An Owner is any account (EOA or SC) that
earns a portion of the Split's income.

After a Split has been created (either
[via the app](/getting-started#using-the-app) or
[calling the contracts](/getting-started#calling-the-contracts) directly), all
you have to do is send ETH or ERC20s to the Split’s address. Each Owner is
guaranteed to receive their share.

### Features

- Splits are **fully composable** on both input & output. Each Split is a
  payable smart contract that can directly receive ETH & ERC20s from any EOA or
  SC. Each Owner is also just an Ethereum address (EOA or SC) for which
  third-parties may execute withdrawals. With full composability on both ends,
  Splits is an effective routing layer within any workflow.
- Splits maximize **gas efficiency** by batching expensive operations &
  commingling funds. The gas to split funds is borne by ownership or covered by
  a third party, eliminating dust and allowing even the smallest Owner to
  withdraw their funds.
- Each Split exists **entirely onchain** and the actions necessary for the
  protocol to operate are incentivized & fully decentralized. With no trusted
  third party to rely on, you can be sure each Split will continue to operate
  for as long as Ethereum exists.

**Splits is a public good and charges no fee for using the protocol.** We think
Splits introduces a novel approach for public goods funding, so if you'd like to
support development of the protocol, just add
[0xsplits.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x50671995e1eca15ca9e807774a814331cabe0f3b)
as a small Owner in the Splits you create.
