# Introduction

0xSplits is a trustless, composable, gas-efficient protocol for splitting
onchain income. Running exactly at gas cost and charging no fees whatsoever, it
takes the form of a [hyperstructure](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html)
that can run for free, forever, without any maintenance or trusted third
parties. The protocol is
[open-source](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2ed6c4b5da6378c7897ac67ba9e43102feb694ee#code)
and
[audited](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-contracts/blob/main/audit/0xSplits_A-1.pdf).

![Basic Overview Flow](/intro-flow.svg)

At the core of the protocol are [Splits](/core-concepts/#split) and
[Recipients](/core-concepts/#recipient). A Split is a payable smart contract
that distributes ETH & ERC20 tokens proportionally among the Recipients. A
Recipient is any address (i.e., externally owned account or smart contract like
another Split) that receives a share of the Split's income. Whenever a Split
receives income, each Recipient gets their share.

These docs are designed to be "progressively technical"—the further you read the
more technical they become. If you're non-technical, new to Ethereum, or just
want to understand how you can use 0xSplits today, start here and keep reading.
If you're a developer looking for integration details, skip ahead to the
[Flow of Funds](/flow-of-funds), [Smart Contracts](/smartcontracts/overview),
and [SDK](/sdk) sections.

### Features

- Splits are **fully composable** on both input & output. Each Split is a
  payable smart contract that can directly receive ETH & ERC20s from any EOA or
  SC. Each Recipient is also just an Ethereum address (EOA or SC) for which
  third-parties may execute withdrawals.
- Splits maximize **gas efficiency** by commingling funds and batching &
  incentivizing expensive operations. The gas needed to distribute funds for all
  Recipients is borne by ownership or covered by a third party, eliminating dust
  and allowing even the smallest Recipient to withdraw their share.
- Each Split exists **entirely onchain** and the actions necessary for the
  protocol to operate are open to everyone. With no trusted third parties,
  upgradable contracts, or infrastructure dependencies, you can rely on Splits
  to operate—exactly as they do today—for as long as Ethereum exists.

### Usage

Splits are valuable whenever you want to allocate percentages of onchain income
to different parties. We believe a composable, gas-optimized, easy-to-use
splitter contract is an important primitive that will help usher in a new wave
of onchain collaboration & giving back. Here are a few ways 0xSplits is being
used today:

- **Onchain Collaboration**: Income from minting NFTs & royalties from secondary
  sales can be pointed to a Split's address. From then on, each Recipient will
  receive their portion of future income without the need for any manual
  disbursements or ongoing maintenance.
- **Giving Back**: Rather than listing a single donation address for an open
  source project and trusting one of the contributors to disperse the proceeds,
  you may simple create a Split and have all donations be automatically
  distributed amongst the contributors. The developers may also grant a multisig
  the ability to modify the Split, allowing them change the Split's composition
  in the future as contributors change.

### Community

We believe Splits introduce a novel way to fund public goods, so we're **testing
it on itself**. If you'd like to support the protocol, all you have to do is add
[donations.0xsplits.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF8843981e7846945960f53243cA2Fd42a579f719)
as a Recipient in the Splits you create. This contract is itself a Split, which
gives back to the communities that have supported the protocol's development to
date. You can check out the Split
