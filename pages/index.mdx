# 0xSplits

**0xSplits** is an easy-to-use, composae, and gas-efficient way to split onchain income with multiple parties.
It is [live for testing](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/) on Ropsten & coming shortly to Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains.

At the core of the protocol are [Splits](/core-concepts/#split) and [Owners](/core-concepts/#owner). A Split is a smart contract that receives and splits incoming funds to the Owners. An Owner is any account (EOA or SC) that earns a portion of the Split's income.

After a Split has been created (either via the app or calling the smart contracts directly), all you have to do is send ETH or ERC20s to the Split’s address. Each Owner is guaranteed to receive their portion. Since everything lives onchain, Owners don’t need to trust each other or any third party to receive their share.

Splits is a public good and earns no fee for using the protocol. If you'd like to support development, you can add the Splits treasury as an Owner in the Splits you create:
