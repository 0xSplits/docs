# Introduction

0xSplits is an efficient, composable, non-upgradable protocol for splitting
onchain income. Running exactly at gas cost and charging no fees whatsoever, it
takes the form of a [hyperstructure](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html)
that can run for free, forever, without any maintenance or trusted third
parties. The protocol is
[open-source](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2ed6c4b5da6378c7897ac67ba9e43102feb694ee#code),
[audited](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-contracts/blob/main/audit/0xSplits_A-1.pdf),
and entirely free to use.

![Basic Overview Flow](/intro-flow.svg)

At the core of the protocol are [Splits](/core-concepts/#split) and
[Recipients](/core-concepts/#recipient). A Split is a payable smart contract
that distributes ETH & ERC-20 tokens proportionally among the Recipients. A
Recipient is any [account](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/)
(i.e., an EOA or smart contract like another Split) that receives a share of the
Split's income. Once a Split has received funds and the
[balance](/core-concepts/#balance) is distributed, each Recipient can
[withdraw](/getstarted/withdraw) their share.

These docs are designed to be progressively technical, meaning the further you
read the more technical they become. If you're non-technical, new to Ethereum,
or just want to understand how you can use 0xSplits today, continue reading. If
you're integrating the contracts into your own app or contracts, you may want to
skip ahead to the [Flow of Funds](/flow-of-funds),
[Smart Contracts](/smartcontracts/overview), and [SDK](/sdk-info/overview)
sections.

### Features

- Splits are **fully composable** on both input & output. Each Split is a
  payable smart contract that can directly receive ETH & ERC-20 tokens from any
  other account. Each Recipient is also just an Ethereum address (externally
  owned account or smart contract) for which third-parties may execute
  withdrawals.
- Splits maximize **gas efficiency** by commingling funds and batching &
  incentivizing expensive operations. The gas needed to distribute funds for all
  Recipients is borne by ownership or covered by a third party, eliminating dust
  and allowing even the smallest Recipient to withdraw their share.
- Each Split exists **entirely onchain** and the actions necessary for the
  protocol to operate are open to everyone. There are no infrastructure
  dependencies or trusted third parties, and all the contracts are
  non-upgradable. You can rely on Splits to operate—exactly as they do today—for
  as long as Ethereum exists.

### Usage

Splits are valuable whenever you want to split onchain payments among multiple
parties. Here are a few brands using 0xSplits today:

- **Platforms**: Sound, Bonfire, Decent, 1stDibs
- **DAOs**: Nouns, SuperRare, Bankless
- **Collectives**: Protocol Guild, Songcamp, Metalabel
- **Musicians**: Daniel Allan, Reo Cragun
- **NFT projects**: Galverse, Denzadol, Holly+
- **Dev shops**: Props, Quantum

### Public Goods

We believe Splits introduce a novel way to fund public goods, so we're testing
it on itself. If you'd like to support the protocol, all you have to do is add
[donations.0xsplits.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF8843981e7846945960f53243cA2Fd42a579f719)
as a Recipient in the Splits you create. This contract is itself a Split, which
gives back to the communities that have supported the protocol's development to
date. You can see the Split's details
[here](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/splits/0xF8843981e7846945960f53243cA2Fd42a579f719/).

feedback. We're a small, funded, growing team of developers focused on this full
time and would love to hear from you.
