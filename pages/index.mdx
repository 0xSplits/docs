# 0xSplits

**0xSplits** is an easy-to-use, composable, and gas-efficient way to split a onchain income with multiple parties.
It is [live for testing](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/) on Ropsten & coming shortly to Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains.

After a Split has been created (either via the app or calling the smart contracts directly), all you have to do is send ETH or ERC20s to the Split’s address. Each owner is guaranteed to receive their portion. Since everything lives onchain, owners don’t need to trust each other or any third party to receive their share.

## Core Concepts

- **Split** - a smart contract that receives and splits incoming funds. Each Split has an address, a set of owners, a balance, and a splitter fee. Just like any other payable smart contract, funds can be sent to the Split's address from any other EOA or smart contract

- **Owner** - an externally owned account (EOA) or smart contract (SC) that earns a portion of the Split's income. Owners do not need direct control of the account, since funds can be withdrawn to the owner's wallet by a third party.

- **Balance** - each Split has a balance that increases whenever income is received. This balance must be distributed to the owners before it can be withdrawn by the owners.

- **Splitter Fee** - the percentage of the balance earned by a splitter when they pay the gas needed to split a balance. This fee incentivizes third parties to split balances on behalf of the owners, and makes the gas cost needed to split funds borne by ownership percentage. This fee may be set to 0 for manual or progressive distributions.

- **Splitter** - a third party who pays the gas to split a balance amongst owners, in return for a splitter fee. This architecture allows the gas cost needed to split the funds to be borne in a flat or progressive manner, making it in aggregate more gas efficient for the owners.

- **Withdraw** - accounts with a positive balance can withdraw their funds across all of the splits they receive from in a single transaction. A third party can withdraw for any account, enabling smart contracts who have no user-controlled private keys to still receive their funds.
