# Welcome to 0xSplits

0xSplits is a set of composable,
[open-source](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2ed6c4b5da6378c7897ac67ba9e43102feb694ee#code),
and
[audited](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-contracts/blob/main/audit/0xSplits_A-1.pdf)
smart contracts that make it easy to split onchain payments. Running exactly at
gas and charging no fees whatsoever, it takes the form of a
[hyperstructure](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html) that will run for
free, forever, without any maintenance or trusted third parties. It exists in
the public for the well-being of the public.

![Basic Overview Flow](/intro-flow.png)

These docs are designed to become progressively more technical the further you
read. If you're non-technical, new to Ethereum, or just want to understand how
you can use 0xSplits today, we recommend you continue reading. If you're
integrating the contracts into your own system, you're welcome to skip ahead to
the [Developer tools](/dev) and [Contracts](/contracts) sections.

## Core concepts

At the core of the protocol are [Splits](/core-concepts/#split) and
[Recipients](/core-concepts/#recipient). A Split is a payable smart contract
that distributes ETH & ERC-20 tokens proportionally among the Recipients. A
Recipient is any [account](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/)
(i.e., an EOA or smart contract like another Split) that receives a share of the
Split's income. Once a Split has received funds and the
[balance](/core-concepts/#balance) is distributed, each Recipient can
[withdraw](/getstarted/withdraw) their share.

## Features

- No fees whatsoever – just pay gas
- [Audited](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-contracts/blob/main/audit/0xSplits_A-1.pdf),
  [open source](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-contracts), and
  [verified](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2ed6c4b5da6378c7897ac67ba9e43102feb694ee#code)
  contracts
- Fine-tuned and gas efficient
- Compatible with ETH & ERC-20 tokens
- Live on most EVM chains: Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis, and
  others
- Non-upgradable contracts – guaranteed no breaking changes
- Operates entirely onchain – no third-party dependencies
- Maximally composable – even able to receive from `call` with capped gas
- Batched withdrawals – withdraw across all Splits in a _single_ transaction
  (not a multicall)
- Permissionless withdrawals – anyone can withdraw for any other account
- Automated – bots & third-parties are incentivized to distribute balances so
  Recipients don't have to
- Stackable – Splits can point to other Splits and [modules](/modules/overview)
- Mutable – Splits can be optionally updated by a designated account (EOA,
  Gnosis Safe, smart contract, etc)

## Usage

Splits are valuable whenever you want to split onchain payments among multiple
parties. Here are a few teams using 0xSplits today:

- **Platforms**: Sound, Bonfire, Decent, Tessera, 1stDibs
- **DAOs**: Nouns, SuperRare, Airswap, Bankless
- **Collectives**: Protocol Guild, Songcamp, Metalabel
- **Music**: Daniel Allan, Reo Cragun, Coop Records, Venice Music

## Values

### Features

- Splits are **fully composable** on both input & output. Each Split is a
  payable smart contract that can directly receive ETH & ERC-20 tokens from any
  other account. Each Recipient is also just an Ethereum address (externally
  owned account or smart contract) for which third-parties may execute
  withdrawals.
- Splits maximize **gas efficiency** by commingling funds and batching &
  incentivizing expensive operations. The gas needed to distribute funds for all
  Recipients is borne by ownership or covered by a third party, eliminating dust
  and allowing even the smallest Recipient to withdraw their share.
- Each Split exists **entirely onchain** and the actions necessary for the
  protocol to operate are open to everyone. There are no infrastructure
  dependencies or trusted third parties, and all the contracts are
  non-upgradable.

### Public Goods

We believe Splits introduce a novel way to fund public goods, so we're testing
it on itself. If you'd like to support the protocol, all you have to do is add
[donations.0xsplits.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF8843981e7846945960f53243cA2Fd42a579f719)
as a Recipient in the Splits you create. This contract is itself a Split, which
gives back to the communities that have supported the protocol's development to
date. You can see the Split's details
[here](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/splits/0xF8843981e7846945960f53243cA2Fd42a579f719/).

feedback. We're a small, funded, growing team of developers focused on this full
time and would love to hear from you.
