# Introduction

0xSplits is a trustless, composable, gas-efficient protocol for splitting
onchain income. Itâ€™s non-upgradable, completely free to use, and entirely
onchain.

At the core of the protocol are [Splits](/core-concepts/#split) and
[Recipients](/core-concepts/#recipient). A Split is a smart contract that
receives and distributes incoming funds to the Recipients. A Recipient is any
address (externally owned account or smart contract) that earns a portion of the
Split's income. When a Split earns income, each Recipient receives their share.

### Features

- Splits are **fully composable** on both input & output. Each Split is a
  payable smart contract that can directly receive ETH & ERC20s from any EOA or
  SC. Each Recipient is also just an Ethereum address (EOA or SC) for which
  third-parties may execute withdrawals. With full composability on both ends,
  Splits is an effective routing layer within any workflow.
- Splits maximize **gas efficiency** by batching expensive operations &
  commingling funds. Gas needed to distribute funds is borne by ownership or
  covered by a third party, eliminating dust and allowing even the smallest
  Recipient to withdraw their share.
- Each Split exists **entirely onchain** and the actions necessary for the
  protocol to operate are incentivized & permissionless. With no trusted third
  parties, infrastructure dependencies, or upgradable contracts, you can be sure
  each Split will continue to operate for as long as Ethereum exists.

### Usage

Splits are valuable whenever you want to allocate percentages of onchain income
to different parties. We believe a composable, gas-optimized, easy-to-use
splitter contract is an important primitive that will help usher in a new wave
of onchain collaboration & giving back. Here are a few ways 0xSplits is being
used:

- **Onchain Collaboration**: Income from minting NFTs & royalties from secondary
  sales can be pointed to a Split's address. From then on, each Recipient will
  receive their portion of future income without the need for any manual
  disbursements or ongoing maintenance.
- **Giving Back**: Rather than listing a single donation address for an open
  source project and trusting one of the contributors to disperse the proceeds,
  the developers may simply create a Split and have it receive donations. All
  future donations will be automatically distributed amongst the contributors.
  The developers may also grant a multisig the ability to modify the Split,
  allowing them change the Split's composition in the future as collaborators
  change.

### Community

0xSplits is a **public good that's free to use.** The protocol runs exactly at
gas cost and charges no fees whatsoever. It takes the form of a
[hyperstructure](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html), meaning it can run
for free, forever, without any maintenance or trusted third parties.

We believe Splits introduce a **novel way to fund public goods**, so it's being
testing it on itself. If you'd like to support 0xSplits, all you have to do is
add
[donations.0xsplits.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF8843981e7846945960f53243cA2Fd42a579f719)
as a Recipient in the Splits you create. This contract is itself a Split, which
gives back to the communities that have supported protocol development to date.
