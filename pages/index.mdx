  Learn how 0xSplits is used to power onchain payments
</div>

0xSplits is a set of composable,
[open-source](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2ed6c4b5da6378c7897ac67ba9e43102feb694ee#code),
and
[audited](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-contracts/blob/main/audit/0xSplits_A-1.pdf)
smart contracts that make it easy to split onchain payments. Running exactly at
gas and charging no fees whatsoever, it takes the form of a
[hyperstructure](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html) that will run for
free, forever, without any maintenance or trusted third parties.

These docs are designed to become progressively more technical the further you
read. If you're non-technical, new to Ethereum, or just want to understand how
you can use 0xSplits today, we recommend you continue reading. If you're
integrating the contracts into your own system, you may consider skipping ahead
to the [Developer tools](/dev/sdk) and [Contracts](/contracts) sections, though
we do recommend reviewing the [flow of funds](/flow) first.

## Features

- Free: No protocol fees whatsoever – runs exactly at gas cost
- Unstoppable: Non-upgradable contracts run as long as the underlying network
  exists
- Multichain: Deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum + more
- Open source: All contracts are
  [verified](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2ed6c4b5da6378c7897ac67ba9e43102feb694ee#code),
  [audited](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-contracts/blob/main/audit/0xSplits_A-1.pdf),
  and publicly available on [Github](https://github.com/0xSplits)
- Composable: Each contract has a payable address to receive ETH and ERC20
  tokens
- Efficient: Batched operations maximize gas efficiency at every step
- Onchain: No third party APIs or external dependencies
- Fair: Distribution costs are shared so small recipients aren't screwed
- Incentivized: Bots and third parties perform the repetitive tasks

## Usage

Teams, platforms, and projects of all sizes rely on 0xSplits to power their
payment flows.

- Platforms: Sound, SuperRare, Artblocks, Tessera, Arpeggi, Bonfire, Decent,
  1stDibs
- Collectives: Protocol Guild, Metalabel, Songcamp, Heds
- Musicians: Daniel Allan, Reo Cragun, Coop Records, Venice Music
- DAOs: Nouns, Airswap, Bankless

## Values

We hope that sharing our values publicly will help you understand why the system
is designed the way it is.

- Do one thing and do it well. Empowering creative teams with simple, clear, and
  modular tools is the best way to create enduring value in the ecosystem.
- Trust is hard to build and easy to lose. Security of the system is the highest
  order bit, and the system is only as secure as the foundation upon which it is
  built.
- Growing the pie matters more than growing the slice. Composability within the
  ecosystem is the lifeblood of growth since it's experimentation at the edges
  where the most compelling discoveries happen.
- Tools must be credibly neutral. This means they're rule-based, verifiable &
  open source, easy to understand, simple, and hard—if not impossible—to change.

Join us on [Discord](https://chat.0xsplits.xyz/) to learn more and let us know
what you think. We're a small, funded, growing team of developers focused on
this full time and would love to hear from you.
