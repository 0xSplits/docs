# Withdraw

Withdrawing is the process of transferring your balance from 0xSplits to your
wallet. Regardless of how many contracts you’re earning from, or how frequently
those contracts receive income, it only takes a single transaction to transfer
_all of your balances_ to your wallet. You can do this at your leisure, whenever
gas prices are low or you just want to cash out.

## Withdrawing for yourself

## Withdrawing for someone else

Once a Split you earn from has been distributed, you'll see your withdrawable
balance in the top left corner of the page. If you only have ERC-20 tokens
available to withdraw, you may see a balance of "$0.00" if we can't determine
the ERC-20 token price. Click on your balance to open your account menu.

You'll be able to see all your balances in the dialog that opens. Select the
ones you wish to withdraw and hit "Withdraw Tokens". Once you approve this
transaction in your wallet, the selected balances will be withdrawn from Splits
to your account. You will see your balance has been reset to $0.

If you have any "pending" balances (i.e., Splits you earn from that have
balances waiting to be distributed), those will show up here as well. If you
wish, you may distribute those pending balances before withdrawing.

## Withdrawing for another account

Since Recipients in a Split can be any Ethereum address, including smart
contracts to which nobody holds the private keys, anyone can withdraw balances
on behalf of other Recipients. When you do this, you're effectively paying the
gas needed to send the funds to their wallet.

Just navigate to the account's detail page (either by searching or clicking on
it from the list of Recipients) then select the balances you wish to withdraw
and hit "Withdraw Tokens". This will transfer these balances to the _account's
address_, not your own. By withdrawing "for" another account, you're just paying
the gas needed to send them their funds.

If you're a developer looking to incorporate withdrawals from 0xSplits into into
your own app, just call the [`withdraw`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain#withdraw)
function on `SplitMain`. You can see if the account in question has a balance by
calling the `getETHBalance` and `getERC20Balance` functions on `SplitMain` as
well. The [SDK](/sdk-info/overview) makes this easy.

## Why must you withdraw?

In other words, once the balance of a Split has been distributed, why aren't the
funds automatically showing up in your wallet? This is because the withdraw flow
follows a
[pull model](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/pull_over_push.html)
(i.e., you need to _pull_ your funds from 0xSplits into your account). It's
designed this way for a few reasons.

First, the pull model is far more reliable and secure, making it the
[recommended approach](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/general/external-calls/#favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls)
in Solidity. Pushing funds isn't recommended since it's more likely to fail and
it increases the chance of hitting problems with the gas limit. Additionally,
the push model reduces composability since contracts with hard gas limits
wouldn't be able to send funds to a Split.

Second, the pull model increases gas-efficiency for the Recipients. Since all
your Splits deposit into the same place, you can collect all your distributed
balances in a single transaction. The longer you wait to withdraw your funds,
the more funds pile up, and the more gas you save. This same concept applies to
Splits themselves—instead of paying gas each time a Split receives funds (i.e.,
from Seaport, Zora, etc), all funds can be distributed at once, drastically
reducing gas consumption and ultimately sending more money to the Recipients.

If you're just looking to do a one-time split where gas efficiency,
composability, and manual labor/time don't matter, you may consider using
[disperse.app](https://disperse.app/) or another multisend contract that will
"push" funds to the recipients. However, whoever initiates that transaction will
need to pay the gas to do so and the undoubted wrath of the group should a
mistake be made. If you're doing multiple manual distributions to the same group
of recipients, you're better off using a Split. Check out the
