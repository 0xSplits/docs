# Contracts

This section is broken into two categories.

- **Core contracts:** these are the smart contract building blocks upon which
  all payment flows are built. There are currently four core contracts:
  [Split](/contracts/core/split), [Waterfall](/contracts/core/waterfall),
  [Swapper](/contracts/core/swapper), and [Vesting](/contracts/core/vesting).
- **Templates**: these are pre-built payment flows that stack multiple core
  contracts together. These templates are supported natively within the app
  since they were built by the Splits team, however, you can easily create your
  own templates by stacking the core contacts together. There are currently two
  templates: [Recoup](/contracts/templates/recoup) and
  [Liquid Split](/contracts/templates/liquid).

## Flow of funds

We recommend reading the [flow of funds](/flow) page if you haven't already. The
below diagram shows the different methods for moving funds through the system.
Though each contract's _distribution logic_ is unique, the general three steps
are the same.

1. **Receive**: ETH and ERC20 tokens flow into the contract via `send`,
   `transfer`, or `call` and the contract's balance increases
2. **Distribute**: Once a contract has a positive balance, anyone can call
   `distributeETH` or `distributeERC20` and earn the distributor fee
3. **Withdraw**: can call `withdraw` at anytime for any account, thereby
   withdrawing that account's balance in SplitMain
