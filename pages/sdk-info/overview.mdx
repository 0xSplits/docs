# Splits Development Kit

This page explains how to use the **Splits Development Kit (SDK)**. The SDK
makes it easier to query the [subgraph](/appendices/subgraph) or call
[contract functions](/smartcontracts/SplitMain). You can find the SDK source
code on [Github](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-sdk).

To get started, install the package using yarn or npm.

```bash
yarn add @0xsplits/splits-sdk
```

```bash
npm install @0xsplits/splits-sdk
```
