# Flow of Funds

The below diagram illustrates the key components of the protocol and highlights
the different methods for moving funds between the components. As an
[Owner](/core-concepts#owner), you don't actually have to worry about any of
this, since the [Splitter Fee](/core-concepts#splitter-fee) incentivizes third
parties to call functions (e.g. `splitBalanceFor`) on your behalf.

## How Splits Receive Funds

Splits may receive funds via two paths:

1. Simply send funds to the Split's address via `send`, `transfer`, or `call`.
   These funds will be held in the proxy until they're flushed to `SplitMain`
   the next time `splitBalanceFor(address)` is called on that Split.
1. If the Split is itself an Owner of another Split, it will receive funds when
   `splitFundsFor(address)` is called on the upstream Split.

## How Splits Distribute Funds

Once funds have arrived at `SplitMain`, funds may be split by any third party
willing to pay the gas to call `splitBalanceFor(address)`. This function only
needs to be called once in order for all owners to
[withdraw](https://www.notion.so/Splits-Documentation-1-0-d0f572e8633f47da8ce41ab8da17ce48)
their
[balance](https://www.notion.so/Splits-Documentation-1-0-d0f572e8633f47da8ce41ab8da17ce48).
The party who calls this function will receive the
[Splitter Fee](https://www.notion.so/Splits-Documentation-1-0-d0f572e8633f47da8ce41ab8da17ce48)
as compensation for paying the gas needed to execute the function.

## How To Withdraw Funds

Once funds have been split, they are now able to be withdrawn by end users by
calling withdrawFor(address). A user can call this function via the UI, or any
third party can call this on the account's behalf. This is necessary, since
Owners can be smart contracts to which nobody holds the private keys.

## Summary

1. Funds flow into the Split, either via the `SplitProxy` or directly to
   `SplitMain`, and increase it's
   [balance](https://www.notion.so/Splits-Documentation-1-0-d0f572e8633f47da8ce41ab8da17ce48).
2. As the balance increases, any third party can earn the
   [Splitter Fee](https://www.notion.so/Splits-Documentation-1-0-d0f572e8633f47da8ce41ab8da17ce48)
   by distributing the balance, which zeros the balance on the Split and
   increases the balance for each Owner.
3. Once an Owner's account has a balance, they can
   [withdraw](https://www.notion.so/Splits-Documentation-1-0-d0f572e8633f47da8ce41ab8da17ce48)
   that balance thus collecting from all of their Splits in a single
   transaction.
