# Flow of Funds

The below diagram illustrates the key components of the protocol and highlights
the different methods for moving funds between the components. As a
[Recipient](/core-concepts#recipient), you don't actually have to worry about
any of this, since the [Distributor Fee](/core-concepts#distributor-fee)
incentivizes third parties to call functions (e.g.
[`distributeETH`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain#distributeeth)) on your behalf.
However, you will still occasionally wish to withdraw.

### Receiving Funds

Splits may receive funds via two paths:

1. Simply send funds to the Split's address via `send`, `transfer`, or `call`.
   These funds will be flushed to `SplitMain` the next time
   [`distributeETH`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain#distributeeth) is called.
1. If the Split is itself a Recipient of another Split, it will receive funds
   when [`distributeETH`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain#distributeeth) is called on
   the upstream Split.

### Distributing Funds

Once funds have arrived at `SplitMain`, funds may be distributed by any third
party willing to pay the gas to call
[`distributeETH`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain#distributeeth). This function only
needs to be called once in order for all Recipients to withdraw their share of
the balance. The party who calls this function will receive the
[Distributor Fee](/core-concepts#distributor-fee) as compensation for paying the
gas needed to execute the function.

### Withdrawing Funds

Once funds have been distributed, they can now be withdrawn by calling
[`withdraw`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain#withdraw). A person can call this
function via the web app (or
[smart contract directly](/https://etherscan.io/address/0x2ed6c4B5dA6378c7897AC67Ba9e43102Feb694EE#writeContract#F11)),
or any third party can call this on the account's behalf. Withdrawing for an
account is necessary when Recipients are smart contracts that can't execute the
[`withdraw`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain#withdraw) function themselves (they must,
however, still be able to receive funds).

### Summary

1. Funds flow into the Split and increase its [balance](/core-concepts#balance).
2. As the balance increases, any third party can earn the
   [Distributor Fee](/core-concepts#distributor-fee) by distributing the balance
   to the Recipients.
3. Recipients may then [`withdraw`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain#withdraw) their
   balance, thus collecting from all of their Splits in a single transaction
   (steps 1 & 2 may happen dozens or hundreds of times per Recipient
   withdrawal).
