# Flow of Funds

The below diagram illustrates the key components of the protocol and highlights
the different methods for moving funds between the components. As an
[Owner](/core-concepts#owner), you don't actually have to worry about any of
this, since the [Splitter Fee](/core-concepts#splitter-fee) incentivizes third
parties to call functions (e.g. `splitBalanceFor`) on your behalf.
You will still occasionally wish to withdraw, however!

## How Splits Receive Funds

Splits may receive funds via two paths:

1. Simply send funds to the Split's address via `send`, `transfer`, or `call`.
   These funds will be flushed to `SplitMain` the next time `splitBalanceFor(address)` is called.
1. If the Split is itself an Owner of another Split, it will receive funds when
   `splitFundsFor(address)` is called on the upstream Split.

## How Splits Distribute Funds

Once funds have arrived at `SplitMain`, funds may be split by any third party
willing to pay the gas to call `splitBalanceFor(address)`. This function only
needs to be called once in order for all owners to
[withdraw](/core-concepts#withdraw) their share of the [balance](/core-concepts#balance).
The party who calls this function will receive the [Splitter Fee](/core-concepts#splitter-fee)
as compensation for paying the gas needed to execute the function.

## How Users Withdraw Funds

Once funds have been split, they are now able to be withdrawn by users by
calling `withdrawFor(address)`. A user can call this function via our web app, or any
third party can call this on the account's behalf. This is necessary, since
Owners can be smart contracts which can't execute the `withdrawFor` function themselves (they must, however, still be able to receive funds).

## Summary

1. Funds flow into the Split and increase it's [balance](/core-concepts#balance).
2. As the balance increases, any third party can earn the [Splitter Fee](/core-concepts#splitter-fee)
   by distributing the balance to the Owners.
3. Owners may then [withdraw](/core-concepts#withdraw) their balance,
   thus collecting from all of their Splits in a single transaction 
   (steps 1 & 2 may happen dozens or hundreds of times per Owner withdrawal).
