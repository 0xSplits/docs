# Core Concepts

### Recipient

A recipient is any
[Ethereum account](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account)
(externally owned or smart contract) that earns a portion of the contract's
income. Recipients do not need direct control of the account, since funds can be
withdrawn for the recipient by a third party.

### Balance

Each contract has a balance that increases whenever tokens are received. This
balance must be distributed before it can be withdrawn by recipients. Each
balance is token-specific, meaning a contract may have multiple balances. For
example, if a contract has received both ETH and DAI, it will have one balance
for ETH and one balance for DAI. Balances must only be distributed once in order
for all recipients to withdraw their share.

### Distibution incentive

This is the portion of a contract's balance that is earned in exchange for
distributing the balance. This fee incentivizes bots and third parties to pay
the gas needed to distribute a balance; when the cost to distribute is lower
than the reward (the incentive x the balance) it is economicaly profitable to do
so. This fee also makes the distribution cost borne by recipients, since it's
deducted from the balance.

You can think of this as a payment processing fee paid for proportionally by
recipients. A higher fee leads to more frequent distributions, but results in a
smaller balance going to recipients. This fee may be set to 0% for manual or
progressive distributions. Setting the fee to 0% removes the reward entirely,
meaning someone will need to trigger this manually.

### Mutability

A Split contract can be optionally made mutable. This means that one account is
able to make changes to the Split once it's created. This admin account is set
during Split creation, and has complete authority over the Split â€“ the admin can
change recipients, transfer control to a new account, or remove the admin
entirely (thereby freezing the Split and prevent any future modifications). A
mutable Split can be made immutable, but immutable Splits can never become
mutable.
