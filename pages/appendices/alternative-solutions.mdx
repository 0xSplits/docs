# Alternative Solutions

Before starting this project, we surveyed what
[Mirror](https://dev.mirror.xyz/V_7Jp1hy_g8bz-J1B4Wb5KYSmj5Lt4W7q7cw0noxJsU),
[OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/finance#PaymentSplitter),
[Foundation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1EF0159071b2A5898024cef4b4f78C171b7f48a8#code)
and others had built and focused on optimizations around a few key areas:
composability, gas efficiency & fairness, and onchain-ness. Below we highlight
some key differences between 0xSplits and other implementations of splitter
contracts.

## 0xSplits Advantages

### Composability

- 0xSplits can receive from solidity's `send` / `transfer` or from `call` with
  capped gas
- 0xSplits handles ERC20s & recursive Splits
- 0xSplits can withdraw to contracts that use more than 30k gas in `receive()`
- 0xSplits can withdraw to contracts/accounts that don't have direct access to
  the private keys using [`withdraw`](/smartcontracts/SplitMain#withdraw)
- 0xSplits can be mutable and modified by EOAs or other SCs

### Gas-efficiency & fairness

- 0xSplits is significantly more gas efficient for users in multiple Splits,
  since withdrawals exist on the user/account level instead of the Split level
  (i.e. a user does not need to withdraw for each Split they receive from)
- 0xSplits generates significantly less dust (i.e. funds trapped because of gas
  costs to distribute) since distribution costs come out of the Split's balance
- 0xSplits are progressive or flat depending on the Distributor Fee (vs
  regressive for other splitters)

### Onchain-ness

- All 0xSplits data lives onchain with no infrastructure dependencies or
  potential for censorship
- 0xSplits contracts are non-upgradable, meaning both the protocol and each
  Split is unstoppable and will continue to operate for as long as the network
  does

## 0xSplits Constraints

There are a number of constraints with our current design that are worth
highlighting.

- **Very large groups:** Splits are designed for groups of people less than ~500
  (see [gas estimates](/appendices/gas-estimates)). While you can stack Splits
  multiple layers deep (i.e. Splits that point to other Splits), you will need
  significant funds flowing through the top-level Split to justify the total gas
  cost of distribution. The larger the group, the more you should consider a
  rebasing token or DAO.

- **Single-use:** Splits are most gas-efficient when reused multiple times. If
  the payout is expected to arrive in a single lump sum, something like
  [disperse.app](https://disperse.app/) via a multisig or trusted party may be
  more efficient.

- **Rebasing tokens:** While held in a Split or user balance, rebasing tokens
  will cause accounting issues within your Splits.

- **Fee-on-transfer:** ERC20s flowing through Splits that have a
  "fee-on-transfer" will cause accounting problems within your Splits.
