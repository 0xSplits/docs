# Usage

## When To Use

Splits are valuable whenever you want to allocate percentages of onchain income to different parties.
DAOs are incredibly powerful coordination tools, but we believe they can be too heavy for many smaller project & forms of cooperation.
We want to see onchain collaboration flourish and believe a composable, recursive, gas-optimized splitter with a simple UI is an important missing primitive in the space.

A project that would benefit from using Splits is a group working together to launch an NFT.
The proceeds from minting—and later royalties from secondary trades—can be pointed to a Split’s address.
From then on, each Owner will receive their portion of all future income without any of the group members needing to distribute funds manually.
If the team's work was inspired by another project, they may choose to make that project a small Owner in their Split as a way of giving back & saying thanks.

Another example might be a group of open source contributors who wish to receive onchain tips and donations.
Rather than listing a single donation address and trusting one of the contributors to disperse the proceeds, they may simply create a Split and have it receive the donations.
All future donations will be automatically distributed amongst the contributors, without anyone having to manage it or trust one another.

Each Split is just a smart contract and can interact with other smart contracts on both the inflow and outflow.
And since [Mutable Splits](/core-concepts#mutable-splits) can be modified by EOAs or other smart contracts, we’re excited to see what interesting use cases emerge within the community over time.

## When Not To Use

- **Very large groups:** Splits are designed for groups of people less than ~500. While you can stack Splits multiple layers deep (i.e. Splits that point to other Splits), you should make sure enough funds will flow through the Split, otherwise a large percent of earnings will be lost to gas. The larger the group, the more you should consider some kind of rebasing token or a DAO.

- **Single-use:** Splits are designed to be gas-optimized when receiving income over time. If the payout is expected to arrive in a single lump sum, a [multisend](https://disperse.app/) via a multisig may be more efficient.
