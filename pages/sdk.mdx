# Splits Development Kit

This page explains how to use the **Splits Development Kit (SDK)**. The SDK
makes it easier to query the [subgraph](/subgraph) or call
[contract functions](/core). You can find the SDK source code on
[Github](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-sdk).

<Callout>
 Older versions of the SDK will become partially unusable following the [sunset of the hosted service](https://thegraph.com/blog/sunbeam-upgrade-window/).
 All users should upgrade to the latest version before June 12. For the core SDK any version >= 4.0.0, and for the React SDK any version >= 2.0.0
 Please see the [migration guide](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-sdk/releases/tag/%400xsplits%2Fsplits-sdk%404.0.0), and reach out on Discord with any questions.
</Callout>

To get started, install the package using `yarn` or `npm`.

If you are migrating to v4, please see the
[release note](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-sdk/releases/tag/%400xsplits%2Fsplits-sdk%404.0.0).

## Subgraph Data

Following the [sunset](https://thegraph.com/blog/sunbeam-upgrade-window/) of the hosted service and the release of v4 SDK we recommend everyone to use our SDK to access any data from the subgraph.
You can create an API key by signing up on our app, and accessing your [account settings](https://app.splits.org/settings).
If you think the SDK does not meet your requirements please reach out to the team and we would be happy to help.
