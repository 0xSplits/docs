# Splits Development Kit

This page explains how to use the **Splits Development Kit (SDK)**. The SDK
makes it easier to query the [subgraph](/subgraph) or call
[contract functions](/core). You can find the SDK source code on
[Github](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-sdk).

To get started, install the package using `yarn` or `npm`.

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm']}>

  <Tab>

```bash
yarn add @0xsplits/splits-sdk
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```bash
npm install @0xsplits/splits-sdk
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If you are migrating to v4, please see the
[release note](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-sdk/releases/tag/%400xsplits%2Fsplits-sdk%403.0.0).

## Subgraph Data

Following the [sunset](https://thegraph.com/blog/sunbeam-upgrade-window/) of the hosted service and the release of v4 SDK we recommend everyone to use our SDK to access any data from the subgraph.
You can create an API key by signing up on our app, and accessing your [account settings](https://app.splits.org/settings).
If you think the SDK does not meet your requirements please reach out to the team and we would be happy to help.
